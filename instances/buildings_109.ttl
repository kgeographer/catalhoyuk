B42 is defined by walls F826,F827 and F825 to E,S +W respectively. W + N limit defined by truncation due to Mellaarts excavations. B42 appears to be built over midden to E and earlier building to west.          The main internal features of B42 are similar to those in many other buildings at Catal- platforms F1501+2 to NE +E, bench F1503 on E wall, platform F1510 to S, oven F828 to S and hearths F1507+1520 to W. Building is thought to be level IV or V. A major difference between this building and others is the low number of phases in comparison to 'standard' Catal houses even though the layout is similar: for instance platforms F1501+2 consist  of 3 and 4  episodes of make up and plastering only.                 A domestic aspect to the  house is reflected in hearths F1507+1520 and oven F828, these are located in S part of building, hearth F1520 may have been used for a ?considerable time before being refurbished as F1507.       The main focus of activity appears to have been concentrated on the eastern part of the building within platforms F1501+2 + bench F1503. In fact this division of space (activity?) was layed out in the initial stages and appears to have been planned and part of an intended design from the start.         F1519 divides up the area within  B42, along with bench F1503 into areas for platforms, areas for oven and hearth and floor area. So platforms- special / ritual; oven/hearth- dirty; floor- clean? Even before F1519 constructed, burial F1517 had picked out space which was to become F1501 for special attention.        The platforms 1501+2 + bench 1503 in east of B42 appear to be a focus for activity, particularly burial activity. F1517 has already been mentioned, but burials F1513,1514,1511,1512 were all located on these platforms and all but F1512 were cut through make up (not plaster) before being plastered over, suggesting presentation was an important aspect of these areas. These platforms and bench consist of 3 or 4 phases only, of make up and plastering pos suggesting short lived or unworn/unused and therefore special/different in nature. This is reinforced by suggestion of bucrania on both platforms by niches F1508+9- shrine aspect to building??                   So B42 would appear to be a special house suggested by special burials F1517 with plastered skull, burials into make up, not plaster on F1501+2; the complete marble mother goddess figurine (10475x2); the high finish to platforms and bench in terms of plaster and adornment -bucrania; the few phses of plastering on bench and platforms.        There is also the aspect of zoning and planning, this is a well thought out building; F1519 dividing up interior, F1517 located in a specific place. These zones then appear constant throughout lifetime of building, platforms stay platforms, bench stays as bench, the focal, ritual, clean and dirty areas are constant.      So although B42 has many aspects/ similarities to standard Catal houses ther are times when it sets itself  apart and appears to favour a more 'ritualised' (maybe less domestic?) persona. It would appear that the people who built and utilised this building intended this from the start and didnt stray from their intentions and continued to 'remake the building in its original image.'"""^^xsd:string .

The western platform is of an earlier date and the eastern platform appears to have been constructed over an earlier feature, possibly an oven. Both platforms have evidence of burning on them. The northern platform slumps steeply to the south and is cut by both Neolithic and later features.
Between the northern and southern platforms runs a lip in the floor (F. 1428) which divides a series of clean floors to the east from dirtier floors to the west. At the edge of the northern platform (F. 1409) a molded clay pillar survives to the height of 0.15m. Originally this feature had a square base but later alterations changed this to be rectangular in shape.
At he western side of space 228 an engaged pillastar is visible as a scar in the wall plaster. This feature was robbed out prior to the buildings destruction. The eastern platform in space 228 (F. 1408) is heavily truncated and only a thin strip of the western edge survives.
Space 238 appears to have been a storage area. Two bins were found at he northern end (F. 1426). The space also contained several animal skulls and two baby burials cot into the floor (F. 1430, 1431). The space was destroyed by fire, apparently originating at the northern end of the room.

The walls of Building 46 were constructed in shallow foundation trenches. Beneath the western wall of the building a layer of grey ashy material (11108) was used as a levelling deposit.

	c:description """Building 49 is located in the 4040 area, within grid squares 1050N/1165E and 1050N/1170E. Building 49 had an irregular floor plan, with the northeast corner indented. The building measured approximately 3.85m north-south and 4.30m east-west; with an internal ground plan of c.14.70 sqm.  Building 49 consisted of a central occupation area, Space 100, and a smaller side room, Space 334. Building 49 was constructed on the same footprint of an earlier building; however the walls were slightly offset.

To the north of Building 49 Spaces 103 and 97 were defined during the 1993-94 surface scrape. Neither spaces have been excavated, and hence are poorly understood; however they probably represent further buildings extending to the north. On all other sides Building 49 was bounded by houses, although it shared no common walls with these structures. To the east Building 48 is another small house, consisting of Space 239 and a small northern storage area Space 234. To the south Building 82 consists of Spaces 229 an external Space 241. To the west Space 98 is associated with Building 51, and was built following the burning of Building 52.

The excavation of Building 49 was initially undertaken by the Stanford University field school in the 2003 and 2004 seasons. Excavation of the building was continued in the 2006 and 2008 seasons by the Çatalhöyük Research Project. Building 49 was completely excavated in order to understand the occupational sequence within the structure. Despite its diminutive size Building 49 contained a complex stratigraphic sequence, and represents an architecturally and decoratively elaborate house. The depth of deposits within the building, with evidence of numerous architectural alterations and additions suggests that the house was occupied for a considerable period of time. Despite constant alteration of the building there is also great continuity, with most major features used throughout the occupation. This continuity can also be seen in the reuse of material from earlier construction phases when altering features within the building.

Excavation revealed a typical pattern of dirtier floors in the south of the building, associated with a hearth and an oven, and cleaner white floors in the north. The central floors of the building appear to represent more mixed use with both clean and dirty surfaces. The patchy, worn nature of the floors across the centre of the building indicates regular use. As with most of the houses excavated at the site, most of the surfaces inside Building 49 appear to have been kept very clean during its use, and as a result relatively few finds were recovered from stratified occupation deposits. Several areas of painted plaster were present in Building 49, including geometric wall paintings with red and black paint, walls and features painted solid red, as well as more figurative decoration on the face of the northwest platform. Hearth or oven F.1665 was located in SE corner of Building 49, a typical position for such fire instillations. This feature was sub-rectangular in plan and built against platform F.1666 and a combination of hearth rebuilds and additions to the platform resulted in an expansion of platform F.1666 to the east. The location and size and activities associated with western Space 234 fits a pattern of these small side rooms being used as storage rooms.

Fifteen burials were excavated from Building 49. Fourteen individuals were buried under the northern to platforms and the limbless torso of an older individual was buried in the central area of the building. The majority of the skeletons were disturbed, including six which were missing their skulls and other bones. All of the burials were tightly flexed and several of the burials included grave goods. It is in the northern area that the majority of the painted decoration was concentrated, and this may be in some way associated with the burial process.                                                                                                                                                                    2006:
Excavation of building 49 continued in the later part of the 2006 season and continues to be an interesting structure. The depth and complexity of the stratigraphy within space 100 contrasts sharply with the diminutive size of the building. The building was obviously occupied for a considerable period of time and the patchy worn floors across the centre of the building suggest heavy and regular use. The typical pattern of dirtier floors in the south of the building, associated with hearths and ovens, and cleaner white floors in the north appears to replicated here. The central floor are of the building appears to represent more mixed use with both clean and dirty floors.

The stratigraphy of building 49 is particularly complex and represents the constant alteration and modification of the space with what appears to be puzzling frequency. As well as the addition of new floors and features there is also a constant cutting back and re-modelling of earlier features, as if the occupants are never quite happy with their living environment.

Both the building infill of building 49 and the fill of post retrieval pit [13641] contained horn cores and other interesting animal bones. The material recovered from the post retrieval pit this season was not deliberately placed but dumped within a mixed demolition fill. It is far from clear to me whether this material was deliberately included within the fill or simply dumped material it was not considered worth salvaging during the demolition of the building.

Burial F1492, which cut through the construction layer of platform F1656, was undoubtedly curious. The burial consisted of the limbless torso of an older male with the legs, arms and shoulder blades all removed prior to burial. The ribs and sternum were in place indicating the body was at least partially fleshed at the time of burial. If the initial analysis of the bones is correct, and no cut marks are present, this suggests the body must have been heavily de-fleshed prior to the removal of the limbs and its subsequent burial.

The plaster was removed from sections of the northern and western walls of building 49, directly above the NW platform F1651. Several layers of painted plaster were encountered. On the northern later layer of paint appeared to consist of a solid red colour. Earlier layers 13669 contained geometric designs in red and black paint. Similarly on the western wall a series of overlying  designs 13676, in red and black paint, were recorded. The paintings appear to have been plastered over relatively quickly and then repainted, an identical design was repainted in exactly the same location each time. The designs on the different layers match so closely it is at times difficult to tell them apart.

On the western wall the painting appears to be very early in the sequence, a micro-morphology sample taken from the wall will allow the number of layers of plaster to be counted. Initial examination with the naked eye suggest and initial thick foundation layer was put on the wall, the first few layers of plaster contain the painted designs, these are then sealed by a second thick make up layer and then a series of typically thin re-plastering events."""^^xsd:string .

Subsequently B51 was constructed directly in it, in the eastern half, very close to the floor. This was done by cuting through the burnt infill at lest one meter deep, with a precise lcation on an existing internal division line.

As there exists no visible access point from 269 to 270, the following discussion will focus on S.269. Much canot be said yet as the building has only been excavated to the last surviving  phases.   Walls: interior faces entirely plastered with the exception of the later, southern interior wall (F. 2107) and rectangular sections where the mudbrick is exposed one in S wall 2113 and one above the bench in E wall 2117 right above the bench. E wall 2115 has 2 outcrops into the room,the more southern of which is cut at its end perhaps by a post retrieval (?) pit. A semicircular, plastered niche is located in the NE corner of this room (F. 2135). A "cache" of household tools in 2171 and a small obsidian cluster (U 12132) were the only significant concentrations of finds, otherwise the room fill was nearly sterile. Interior features display several phases of habitation, not all of them worked out yet. A large plastered pillar (F. 2132) seemilngly survived several different phases of th house. While its plaster is connected at one point to the rim of bench/truncated platform 2150, it also extends downwards past the excavated surfaces. Another feature that extends through several use phases is oven F. 2110. It abuts the older wall 2113, but the later wall 2107 was built up against it on either side, leaving its use face exposed. It sits on top of another square hearth, 2134, but I think the two might have been in use at the same time and the 2134 was later replaced by another surface, now preserved as a narrow lip at thebase of 2110 with a trace of burning on its surface. Most of the southern surfaces seem to be in phase: 2151 and 2133 both connect to the smooth floor which seems to be up against (?) hearth 2134. In the SE corner of the room, the floor breaks up into a mixed, "dirty" surface containing lots of bone and debris. This was not excavated; I think it is in phase with the floor surface. The sequence of floor/ living surfaces is increasingly complex in the northern part of the room. Currently visible post-excavation are one floor, later coeverd by mudbrick packing that displayed use compaction and is built up against bench/truncated platform 2150: 2150 is probably contemporary with the lowr surface but still in use with the second surface.  Due to the late trench cutting the room, I cannot with confidence distinguish phases across the whole room, but: the S part of the room displays at least 3 phases: that of eariler hearth 2134 (#1), then the phase with the bench, platform, and 2nd (truncated) hearth and the basin 2132 (#2); later still the phase corresponding to the late wall 2107, the floor of which has been lost (#3). NW part of B 57: #1: lower floor and bench/platform 2150 (?). #2: Surface up against 2150. #3: Pt cut through both these suraces by wall outcrop. Within the liefspan of this building, the life of pillar extends through all the phases and eariler still, and the chronological placement of niche 2171 is uncertain. NE corner of room: wall, flor, niche, lip of platform, all in one phase (?). The bottom of the late trench reveals yet another, earlier, white plaster floor level but the real sequece of phases will remain unclear pending further excavation. UK"""^^xsd:string .

Building 67 also appeared to differ in architectural style and as such was also thought to be considerably later than nearby buildings such as Building 58 to the west.

It extends beyond the S edge of TPC trench 3, but is bounded within the trench by 3 walls: f.3948, f.3984, and f.7150. It contains three bins-- plastered at the bottom and containing burned deposits consisting only of ash and charcoal. The bins were built in succession, and the most likely earliest one (f.7152) is the deepest, suggesting that the use of these bins may have involved scooping from them and deepening over time, or they were systematically emptied after use. All of the features in this building, including all bins, walls, and the floor, show signs of having been plastered. 4 complete vessels were found in situ on the floor of the building (in u.30246). Also noteworthy is the number of roof finial sfound in wall f. 7150. See space sheet (509) for a sketch of the building's features. A 3D model was also created for this building on 14/07/13. The function, we hypothesize to be a kind of storeroom as it contains three plastered bins but its builders did not appear to spend very much time establishing a flat floor (it slopes up toward the east) and it does not seem like a building meant for elaborate display, rather a functional building. We found as well vessels used for shipping (see 30246.x3) and other large vessels (30246.x1 and 30246.x4); the shipping containers especially suggest this building played a role in trade and redistribution. The lack of ovens or hearths make the building unlikely to have been a domestic space, although extension of excavation to the south might alter this interpretation, and the haphazard style of construction is often characteristic of Iron Age houses in this area."""^^xsd:string .
