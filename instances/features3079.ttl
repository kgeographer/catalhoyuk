The first episode involved the cutting of a rectangular hole [2054], fifteen pieces of Obsidian (2039) were placed in the hole and it was filled by (2055). At some indeterminate time later a shallower hole [2052] was cut and thirty five pieces of obsidian (2038) were placed in the hole before it was filled with (2053). The group (2039) were bunched and may have been in an organic container but there is no indication that (2038) was in any container. Some of the obsidian was broken. This may have been through packing episode (2030) but could equally have been caused by pressure during Mellaart's excavations. The caches were probably located just inside a blocked doorway visible on the southern wall of space 113 - a classic liminal location. An earlier cut [2063] in the same area may be related although it did not contain obsidian."^^xsd:string ;

They were removed in unit 6306 together with their packing (orange) and black soil in between. While cleaning, it was discovered that one of the youngest lines of platform extensions (F. 169) is connected to this level.

It was overlain by u. 30246, which either represents an occupation layer or the deposit associated with the building's destruction and abandonment. At the bottom of this unit (on top of the floor), there was a homogeneous layer of essentially pure charcoal which likely represented matting on the floor (or, alternatively, roofing material which fell and burned). Remnants of plaster remain in some sparse places, suggesting the whole floor may have been plastered when the building was in use. It was also plastered at its base, as we discovered upon excavation of u. 30273-- which may have been an initial attempt at flattening what was an extremely uneven cut into Neolithic building material, [30299]. None of this plaster was preserved enough for it to be removed as a separate layer, however. The plaster on the floor of this building represents a fair amount of investment into the architecture of this building, suggesting it may have been fairly important."^^xsd:string ;

MCD 2006:: 
A number of floor layers were excavated revealing a small number of features - small pits. 

A number floor layers were removed from the main floor space 227: F2129 in 2006. The upper levels were very truncated, but with depth the layers become more continuous and easier to define. 2129 was excavated dwon to unit 13239 a plaster surface that seems to stretch across the entire floor - though not fully exposed. A packing layer above 13239 = 13230 also seemed to stretch across the entire floor and produced a small ?animal figurine from against the North wall.
A number of floor layers 13219 down to 13239 (and possibly continuing) dipped down into feature 2251. At floor 13239 none of the platforms in B58 had been released ie: all the above layers butted up against the platforms. However, the hearth F.2122, wall F.2001 and ridge F2193 are all stratigraphically later than at least 13239 - and probably many layers later - and need to be removed before further excavation in F.2129. Three small pits were revealed at various layers whilst excavating F.2129 see features 2250, 2252 and 2253 for details. All of the layers seemed to be roughly the same depth, but, like the entire building, sloped to the South."^^xsd:string ;

The basal deposit of hearth F.806 appears to have been a levelling deposit over the redundant oven of the previous phase and probably derived from the dismantlement of that ven superstructure, whereas the description of the overlying deposit (4998) suggests accumulation of occupation and 'use', probably during the use of oven F.557, and possibly prior to the overlying hearth F.806.

The hearth F.806 was created in a shallow scoop (5120) cut against the eastern face of the post-retrieval pit (4982).  In its truncated state it measured 0.6 by 0.22 m and 70 mm deep, and probably c. 0.6 m in diameter in its complete form.  The base was carefully prepared with predominately clay ball fragments and some stone set within a firm but friable, dark brown silty clay and ash matrix (5117), the clay ball and stone fragments creating a stable and thermal retentive base.  The lower part of a small seated human figurine 5117.H1, less than 10 mm high (Volume 5, Chapter 9) was also recovered from this deposit, but may be an accidental inclusion. An overlying possible 'use' deposit was 'light brown silty clay' (5119) with 'small stone fragments, charcoal and plaster' (US 5119, AB, 07.08.99). This was more likely a consolidation layer over the clay ball base, which became friable through subsequent firings. An overlying layer (5118), probably represents acumulation through use, made up of 'loose, light brown to grey, clayey silt with small and medium stone, clay balls fragments, charcoal, plaster and ash' (US 5118, AB, 07.08.99).  During excavation this was interpreted as part of an overlying basin F.521, which replaced this hearth in the subsequent phase, however, during post-excavation analysis it was recognized as part of the hearth sequence F.806.\" p. 118

(11322) and (11323) are N/S with (11321) E/W at northern end and (11329) E/W at southern end- see plan for exact layout. F1519 appears to have been constructed more or less as a coherent whole and probably at around the same time as bench F1503.

This is one of the initial phases of construction or internal installations after building 42 walls were built and initial surfaces laid.

Several bricks show plastering on some faces, however they are hidden faces or discontinous (see [11329]). This suggests these bricks were reused from some other place and not intended to be seen. 

F1519 appears therefore to be and initial laying out of space within building 42.  Bench F1503 appears to be first, the F1519 was constructed to demarcate areas for platforms F1501 and F1502 with (11321) specifially marking boudary between them. (11329) makes a N/S boundary within space 202. It is therefore possible to say area to N or (11329) and W of (11323/2) was floor and 'clean.' Area to E of (11323/2) were platforms and 'special; activity. The area to S of (11329) contained the oven and hearths and more floor areas and there fare 'dirty' areas of B42.

The laying out of F1519 was a little 'slapdash' as it wasn't perpendicular or flush to bench 1503. (11321) was oreintated parellel to bench though. This then was later hidden by platforms F1502/ F1501, which was constructed over (11323) to give a continous face to platforms and bench of high qualiity. 

Does this suggest bad workmanship or that the initiral laying out didn't have to be perfect as getting the idea of the space physically layed out was more important? So not only dividing up internal fixtures, but activities also."^^xsd:string ;

All kilns except for the most eastern one had perforated base set on top of a relatively thick layer of burnt black and brown soil. The largest kiln is located from eastern side and it is destroyed to such a degree that no reliable reconstruction is possible.

  c:description "This consists of 58 units removed individually including a few arbitrary layers. It is a mixture of plaster/marl layers and moulded layers made of a light, chaffy material, plus a few mortar-type deposits and several covering layers which appear to have wrapped around the object at some time. By 1998 season the feature had been truncated horizontally at the E and vertically at the S. As a result it has been extremely complicated taking it apart and no defintive conclusion can be made as to what it was. In fact, it seems that part of it is still in the ground at the W end, and this may hold the key, it suggests that the feature may have been a bin, and that what I have excavated is a complex bin-roof with a small work platform on it, which had all collapsed. However, it may indeed have been an animal head moulding or something similar, but it does not make sense as one now.
What is clear is that a number of elements were deliberately moulded into shape and that the material is much less dense and more chaffy than normal brick. A great deal of layering of deposits took place, suggesting either a gradual building of a moulding or continous alteration/repairs to a moulding or a bin.

In the centre, below a few layers, was a semi-circular, flat white platform (3634) with an upright marl 'back stop' (3399) suggesting a grinding platform or work area. This could have been on the roof of a bin, the possible wall of which is at the SW edge and a possible other wall survives on the N wall at the E, in the fill. However, we still do not know what it really was. It should be noted that a thin orange-brown render was found on the upper surface of parts of (3300) base plaster at both E and W ends and that a smear of similar/same material is adhering to the S face of the N wall of the room opposite F.279.
Unit (3300) was a plaster wrapping layer which ran horizontally, below most of the units, up the N face and over the top of the moulded horn-shaped unit (3394). However, on the S face it rather dissapeared, being overlain by several smaller deposits of plaster and bricky soil. At the W end deposits continued beneath (3300), but the whole thing fitted neatly, into the curve of (3953), the possible bin wall and no stray fragments suggested major breakage of either structure to accommodate the other. One interpretation is that (3300) lined the roof of a bin, and the whole superstructure, with (3300) at the base, has fallen within the bin area. However, excavation lower down is required to test this.
NB; (3300) is not a simple unit but probably several layers mixed up."^^xsd:string ;

The ladder wasa probably not as we imagine a conventional ladder with two support and ledges, but most likely a single timber either carved for foot space, or foot supports added. The angle of the ladder is steep at 75 degrees.

  c:description "This is a bizarre feature - a cylindrical hole was cut or left in the wall. Into this was placed a packing of orange-brown clayish soil, followed by a thin layer of a pale similar soil with a few bone fragments (2178), they the appear to have inserted a ready-made object consisting of an oval cone of bricky clay material covered with multiple layers of plaster, some of them painted red. IT seems impossible that this was made in situ. The top of the cone was n the centre of the wall, pushed close up against the packing material, & the broader base was flush with the wall & fitted exactly the cut on the wall surface (2179) - another peculiarity. The wall was then plastered over, hiding the construction completely.

Discussion:
This is peculiar because of the closeness of fit on the face of the wall, & the requirement to make the moulding before putting it in the wall due to the heavy plastering came(?) out (coned out?). On the one hand, since the fit is so good, it seems the hole was cut to fit the moulding, however, if so, why did they cut it with straight sides & not make it fit the moulding inside the wall? It is possible it was all done while the wall was being made, yet this is not a case of a gap between 2 bricks - the bricks above & below are cut to accommodate the moulding. When the wall is taken apart we just might get more clues.
The moulding could be regarded as a 'breast', or as something abstract. Whatever it was, why was a it put in a wall where it could not be seen due to the plastering?"^^xsd:string ;

It seems like there are at least two phases in the niche construction. The niche was built up against the original west wall. The actual niche is the earliest phase, later on white plaster was added on the top of the niche and this space could have been used as a bin. This space also had an ashy fill layer with charred seeds and nuts, but not as dense as the ashy fill within the niche.

  c:description "defined 1997: clay oven. Not yet excavated

excavated 1998:
Clay fire installation in SW corner of space 117 which abuts walls 93 to west and 279 to south. Lopsided dome shape (higher in west) there has been more than one phase of this oven. This is evidenced by
i, two floors 3383 and 3607
ii, scorched scar of early shape of oven roof on wall 79
iii, shape of oven lining 3171 in half section of oven which suggests that in an earlier phase the oven had a steeper profile but later the roof flattened out. There is only one unit No for this lining as so far it has been impossible to distinguish between the two phases whilst excavating although the south beyond the half section hasn't been excavated yet (25/08/98)
iv, the oven has been truncated to the East by bin 257 and from above by bin 256. This in itself doesn't signify another phase of oven and it could easily be in disuse by this time, the stratigraphy proves neither one or the other. However the oven has been replastered on the outside many times (rendering 3170) this has been truncated at the top by bin 256 but there are at least two other layers of rendering 3175 and 3162 which cover both the oven and N facing outside wall of F256 & 257. To me this suggests that both were in use at the same time as otherwise, why not just plaster completely over the front of the oven and its backfill. This may be a huge assumption though as there may be some reason why the oven still needs to be remembered as an oven when out of use rather than a stand to put a bin on. The deliberate backfilling hints at this. It would be much easier just to demolish the oven and start again except of course if extra height was needed for the bin.
The oven appears to have collapsed slightly on the West, fill 3389, then been deliberately backfilled 3143, 3137. Then it seems the oven roof has collapsed in the centre [3373] depositing fragments of oven roof 3132, 3136 on top of backfill. This collapse could be  caused by the truncation from above by bin 256 and perhaps the setting and compressing of the backfill leaving a void at top of oven which would be prone to collapse if too much weight  was put onto it. There is a possibility that there was a deliberate hole made in top of oven but it didn't' look likely as edge slightly irregular and tapered at edge. The last fill of oven 3124 was probably introduced from this hole 3373 in top of oven as the fills are quite compact and I don't see how it could have been made to fill all the extent of oven if deposited from the front. This fill could be deliberate backfilling or equally could be seepage down form fills of bin above into oven.
The oven appears to built by cutting a depression (through plaster  feature to East) [3643], laying down the floor 3607 and then building superstructure on top 3365 and then lining 3171.
Floor 3383 doesn't reach edge of oven walls in most places, although it does at the front and underlies physically 3171. Possibly the floor was added after first phase of use but when some at least of oven wall was standing, then the whole oven was relined afterwards. It has been impossibly to tell any differences so far between build of oven 3365 however there is evidence of use  from 2 phases of the oven with two small ashy layers. The first 3606 overlies floor 3607. The second 3147 overlies floor 3383. This thin layer is thought to be same as 3157 and very similar material that overlaid rim of oven floor. This suggests that it was raked out. I think also that last year an ashy layer was excavated, 2820, leaving a small section in front of oven. 3147 and 3157 are probably part of the same deposit."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "F528 was a pure clayey construction forming a low step-like partition seperating the northern and southern (clean and dirty) parts of the eastern half of space 178 / building 23. F.528 was a ong E-W oriented  strip of clayey material which formed a a formal partition between the northern and southern halves of the eastern half of building 23 / space 178. It ran from wall F.467 to its east, to an earlier cut and stone cluster (F    ) to the west. It is unlikely stratigraphically that the partition extended further to the west but it seems to have respected the location of this earlier feature. To the north it was overlain by a series of 'clean' floors (4504). To the south, it was overlain by a series of truncated floors, floor-make-up and occupation debris (4583). This suggests that it formally marked the area in the building for 'dirty' and 'clean' use. It appears to have been roughlt contemporary to the use of fire instalation F.529 on the southern wall of the building which is related to the same 'dirty' floor deposits.
It was made up of a central strip of dark grey / brown clay which was then 'grouted' into place using a bright orange/brown clay. This construction gives the partition its unusual profile in section (see above) so that the orange/brown clay appears to both overlie and underlie the grey-brown clay. The concentration of phytoliths + charcoal on the upper southern surface of the partition could have resulted from an irregularity in the clay matrix or treading on its dirtier side."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "The wall was built on top of the floor #10 in the western wing of building 3, along west edge of platform F. 162 and has the same length as the platform (130 cm app.). Wall plaster (unit #8121) joined with floor #5 of F. 162 at the bottom. Underneath plaster there was the same tan packing that underlaid floor #5 of F. 162. These deposits were moist and full of salts. 
Upper part of F. 772, especially its west side, contained soft crumbly material with thin fragments of brick. Combination of brick and mortar is the same as in F. 1000 : red crumbly brick and beige concrete-like mortar layered together.
The brick and mortar mix of the wall itself actually overlies the plaster of floor #6/7 of F. 162. On the west surface there is no plaster face but a 1 cm thick layer of mortar to smooth the wall as well as to line the posthole F. 766 (taken as S.3 of unit #8402). Mortar is also used to level wall at bottom of #8402 of phase of wall contemporary with floor #5 of F. 162.

An animal hole in the lower part allows us to see that the pillar is apparently made of solid plaster. There seems to be 2 batches of plaster - possibly a later layer on W-E wall which is peeling away from the main corner structure. This may really be wall plaster on the W-E wall, overlapping the pillar. A skim of floors is visible abutting the pillar, on the W-E wall.

Foundation Trench 14 is located between the southern ends of Buildings 64 and 55. The earliest phase of occupation excavated in the foundation trench was the upper parts of a N-S and an E-W wall forming the NE corner of a building continuing to the south and west. The walls of this building were plastered (14939) and may relate to evidence for buildings under the midden excavated in 2006 to the west (Space 280 Archive Report 2006). The floor level of the building was not reached as it was below the formation level for the foundation trench."^^xsd:string ;

only one course surviving of this wall

From Archive Report 2007:

[The earliest excavated feature within this trench was a \"double\" wall, or rather two parallel walls F.2820 and F.2821.] They were both laid in a north-south orientation and extended from the northern L.O.E continuing into the eastern L.O.E with the butt ending roughly 1.0m south from this. The bricks in the western wall F.2820 measured 1.0m x 0.32m x 80mm and were formed from firm light greyish brown fine sandy silt. The mortar was up to 20mm thick and consisted of firm, mid brownish grey sandy silt. There was only one brick visible within the L.O.E and no mortar. This brick (15097) was made from firm, light yellowish brown sandy silt. Another ‘double wall’ directly overlaid F.2820 and F.2821 but extended across the length of the trench in a N-S direction and as with F.2820 was only one course high with the eastern extent of the wall continuing into the eastern L.O.E."^^xsd:string ;

Two fills within pit (10415) and (10418). Very similar and probably same fill in actuality. Lower fill contained obsidian point/tool (poss. Spear?head). Fills possibly deliberately backfilled rather than accumulationm deposits, as so similar to material into which pit is cut.
Also lots of animal disturbance.

Pit cut into floor of building 42 next to and truncating hearth F1507. Function of pit uncertain, although it appears to have been deliberately backfilled prior ro end life of building. May be associated with end life of hearth and obsidian point placed there to mark it?
Pit may have functioned as a \"cache\" where again deposition of obsidian point may mark the cleaning out of this caches.
So pit possibly having a functional and symbolic role in the use and end life of this building.

SMc 07/08/05: During excavation (05 season) we stepped  in 1m and section revealed that northern part of F1506 extended down for aprox 20cm more, but we did not excavate it. Also F1528, large animal burrow just to north is abbutting(cutting?) this.

- Broadly E-W orientated.
- Coursing identified as quite regular - 7 courses remained in total, mostly  slightly clay silt (with a few greyer, more sandy anomolies).
- Initially suspected as being 2 walls, hence duble numbering of bricks and morter. As such  u(15091) - bricks & u( 15092) - morter, refer to the uppermost 2 courses, which prior to excavation seemed to be a different build; however excavation proved this to be untrue. Nevertheless, the numbers remain split so as not to cause confusion with the respective compositional samples.
- It turned out that the uppermost courses had just dried much more due to their proximity to the surface of the trench.

The southeathern corner of the buttress has been truncated by  grave = unit 16883.
No individual mudbricks identified.

JMR 22.8. 2010: Buttress F.5052 forms one of the four buttresses in the (probable) lower storey of building 98. It separates Spaces 340, 452 and 450. Buttress consists of reddish-grey mudbrick. Some plaster remaining in south, east and west, no brick/ mortar visible in plan. Upper part of 5052 very disturbed by pits and graves. Buttress at least 0.44m high (18.8. In Space 340) originally, during the 2010 season the upper ca.25cm were removed to check stratigraphy in this area.
5052 abuts F.2428, there is a very thin gap or crack (1cm) in between them. Lower part of 5052 is abutted by mudbrick construction (bench?) F.3334 in South and East. 3334 is put against the plaster of 5052 - thus probably a later addition. F.3320 and 3335 seem to abut F.5052, as they seem to respect ist original outlines, but plaster coating of F.5052 not preserved in this part, so might as well be cut by 3335 and 3320. Possibly not only 3334, whose base does not continue down to the same level as other features in B.98 (walls, buttresses), but also F.3320, 3325 and 3321 might be later additions to B.98. 3320 and 3335 might have cut eastern continuations of 2428 and 2429 and also eastern part of 5052.

It did not have that many artifacts, and was quite firm in consistancy. The bricks and mortar were clearly defined and seem to be sitting on an older mudbrick wall construction (feature 3962)."^^xsd:string ;

As an \"empty cut\" as such, it seems that it was carefully cleaned and then filled with \"clean\" soil. It is very hard to say why it was made in the first place, perhaps as storage or container of some kind. Perhaps its function can be tied to its proximity to the hearth opposite it.

This feature was excavated during the seasons of 1996 and 1997.

Large platform bounded by two projecting walls to the north (F8) and to the south (F10), which may or may not have continued to the ceiling. The platform itself consists of multiple floors and packing layers, with two post-settings at either end of the boundary walls. A heavy burning phase occured, concentrated in the south west corner under reducing conditions, but there was an even earlier burning phase too under more oxidising conditions in the same place. The burning can be traced on the walls, the wall plaster, the floor, and even on some of the human bones in burial F 29. 
The platform was later converted into a separate room, space 110.
Along the floor and the southern wall, a red-painted plaster phase was identified.

Discussion:
Principal platform of building 1, associated with burials; unlike platform F 13, it underwent little modification, possibly because of the bounding walls F 8 and F 10. It's main characteristic, over time, is the large number of re-floorings compared with the other platform F 13 (although, here much truncation and modification to the platform may have removed many floors). At the end of it's life, probably, the posts were removed from the ends of the walls and the area was converted into a small room (space 110) by the addition of a cross wall along the western edge (F 9). 
Especial focus seems to have been given to the southern side of floors and walls, noted exclusively here; special deposits in the southern post-cavity (including axe blade); and finally, burning, which was most intense in the middle of the south wall F 10. Why does all the focus take place here?"^^xsd:string ;

5057 is seperated from walls 5056 and 333 by a very thin gap of 1cm width. The form of the buttress is slightly irregular, because the two walls south of it are not exactly in line.

  c:description "Platform excavated in two parts. In 2002 southern extent excavated in foundation trenches as F.845.
In 2004 northern extent excavated as F.1510. Post ex 2011 the two feature numbers were amalgamated and platform now known as F.1510. 
All data from F.845 see below (SF 30/09/11)

Remains of platform to south of bench F1503 truncated to south by shelter foundation. Made up of two thicker make up layers (10444) and (10443) - overlying this was (10441) which consisted of numerous finer layers of approx 12 different episodes of plastering and make up - also at this stage as the becnch was increasing in height it also expanded to the west by approx 20cm.
Cleaning layer (10424) removed some fragmentary plaster fragments from upper surface which may have related to a surface or to general debris.
(10442) is plaster facing on south of bench F1503 and it also consists of several episodes of replastering suggest these replastering episodes of bench are occuring at same time as (10441), replastering of platform f1510, but have been seperated on matrix.

Feature 1510 represents the remains of a platform to the south of bench F1503, truncated by shelter foundation. The make up of the platform shows two distinct basal layers followed by numerous episodes of plastering and make up represented by (10441).
The elaboration or probably more likely refurbishment of the platform seems to have been a frequent event as evidenced by the fine layers in (10441). Also these fine layers of plaster may have been more prone to wear and tear necessitating frequent repair.
The replastering of the southern face of bench F1503 at the same time or similar time to replastering of platform may suggest that rather than just patching worn areas, an opportunity to re-plaster larger areas may have been taken. Indeed it may have been a yearly event and unrelated to actual condition of plaster surfaces.
So platform F1510 fits within the 'usual' ideas of agglomoration and elaboration of platforms within a building.

Platform  recorded as F.845 in 2002 excavations. Below data from F.825

N-S 105cm (and continues to N); W-E 110cm

The platform was previously excavated together with the house floor - u. 5427.  It was difficult to distinguish the platform because of the narrow trench and the pit, which damages its W edge.  The platform is rectangular or quadrangular in plan/it is difficult to say because it continues to N, under the N profile of the trench.  It has slightly elevated edges.  The relation with the oven is lost because of the pit, but the relation to the \"kitchen\" area floor is easy to trace.  The platform is slightly higher than the floor, c. 2-3 cm.  The edges are rounded.  The platform consisted of successive floors and packings.  The floor is 1 cm thick, made of fine yellowish-gray clay and the packing is 2.5-5cm (thicker to the edges) brown clay.  The surface is nicely smoothed. TS 27/07/2002"^^xsd:string ;

From Archive Report 2008: 
The North-West platform (F.1651) was used to bury nine individuals, including both children and adults. The majority of  these skeletons were disturbed, including six which were headless. It is in this northern area  that the majority of the painted decoration was concentrated, and this may be in some way  associated with the burial process. All of the burials were tightly flexed and several of the  burials included grave goods. As with most of the houses excavated at the site, most of the  surfaces inside Building 49 appear to have been kept very clean during its use, and as a result few finds are recovered from stratified occupation deposits.

It has a partition wall, F1816, that is quite high (to its east) and so it does also seem to look like a large bin.  The platform slopes down towards the middle from all sides.  It has been constructed with a light greyish brown clay loam, similar to that of bench F1808.  It has been lined by a very fine layer of plaster that has not been preserved throughout its surface.  The western and southern sides have lips formed by multiple layers of plaster, however the plaster is not continuous-- this may be because of cutting or some sort of truncation.  This non continuous plaster is about 1cm thick and has multiple layers, and gives an impression that it has been there since the beginning of the occupation of this building."^^xsd:string ;

This feature is not excavated in 2004 (only fill within the rim 7950) because it is between phases other than existing features.  To date, we interpret this feature as a shallow basin or collapsed bin.  It consists of a presumably continuous retaining wall on the north, west and south sides,  Maximum preserved height of this wall in the NE is 19 cm.  The wall consists of a orange brick core with plaster.  It seems to be cut in the east and preceeds (goes under) the partition wall F.1659.  The surface under the bin fill 7950 looks similar to the surface in 1852 ane perhaps similar to the truncated surface (7944) over 1656.

JLD 15/08/06
This feature number was used to describe a ?bin? In 2004 but has beenused in 2006 as the number for the repeatedly extended and cut back platform between the internal wall F1659 and the S wall F 1658. Several basins have been constructed upon (F1652) or cut through (F1497) the platform at various points, floors have been cut back (see truncated edges on plan 06/1212 and pits dug [13648].  Other unexcavated features are also visible such as a much earlier basin wall (F1498) and a large pit beneath pit [13648] visible in plan and section in truncated area.
It is possible that the truncated floors at the NE corner of the platform may represent another episdoe of hearth construction removed prior to 2006 (just an idea though, no proof!)
1) Small square platform constructed, possibly as an extention to an earlier feature abutting the internal wall F1659.
2) Several floor layers added and small basin constructed in NW corner
3)Platform extended to the N, covering basin F1497, wall constructed along N edge of platform
4) Platform extended to the E.
5) Hearth cut into platform [14413]
6) Hearth cut into platform [13645]

For reasons that escape me now we renumbered this platform F.4007 at some point during the 2006 excavation. In my final report I refer to the south platform as F.4007 throughout the sequence. It is one feature that undergoes extensive modification. DE 2010"^^xsd:string ;

It is characterised by a clear rim around its eastern and southern edge and thick plaster layers. Obvious relationship with red wall plaster of F. 160 (eastern side) and the thick red plastered north wall (F. 174). 
The platfrom was cut at least 4 times by burial cuts (F. 617, 634, 644, 647). In Byzantine times it was cut by grave in its northern side. South of the grave over the platform was the roof collapse. Even in 1997 it was suspected that a platform lay not far below the concentration of falllen white plaster (unit #2202).
In lower part of the fill (unit #2269) fragments of red painted plaster were included. At this level the eastern wall of the platform was visible. The roof collapsed onto the floor just south of the platform. To the north of the roof is vertical fallen plaster and roof. This means that the layers above the platform floor are collapsed north wall. 
The NW corner of this platform is always characterised by the same powdery plaster as the north part of F. 173 - maybe it represents eroded or broken down floors by some weathering action (units #2221, 2259, 2269). 
In 2000 floor #2 was removed - white plaster with white packing underneath. Edges were taken off separately.

  c:description "A platform-like feature between F.637 and the scapularium. On its west edge the feature is bounded by two scapulae (X  , X  ). The fill was typical platform fill: brown-reddish moist material, fine bricky fill. Flotation sample was taken from the whole surface. 
At first this whole surface in the S-E corner of space 86 was divided into F. 637 which represented lower part of the entrance area, and then F. 167 which represented a step or a platform attached to the south wall. After removing a step, the whole surface was defined as platform F. 167. This platform is situated in the area where most probably lader for entering the house was. We came to this conclusion after considering multiple deposits of floor and packings on it. It is part of the dirty area of building 3 and consists of series of replasterings. It was truncated in prehistory again  because of the lader. In its N-E part it is cut by a post-retrieval pit (F.168). Northern edge comprised some floors of platform F. 170. A scapula was found, probably supporting the fill of the pit, which contained high amount of burnt ashy material. 
Continuation of excavation in this area revealed new layers of plasterings and packings that were built on top of an older feature. In a basin formed between a small plaster lump attached to south wall (earlier \"step\") and the eastern wall there was a dark burnt layer of packing material. This extended towards the middle of the basin. The basin measured 55cm X 54 cm. Further excavation showed that the lower floor plasterings and packings extended beyond this basin and into the east wall (unit 8144; F. 762), and into the niche (f. 768) in the east wall. The packing varied from light orange and soft (upper layers) to a more coarse, thicker, hard orange brown packing (lower level). All of the upper floor layers were removed. The early floor extended into the niche and to the north of the earlier floor plasterings and packings. After removing this fill from the basin in the corner between east and south wall and kitchen area, a small plaster step feature was clearly defined, a place where the lader was leaning on the south wall.

On top of the platform two fire installations were found. Feature 630 close to the east edge of the platform and feature 632 in the northeast edge of the platform.

This feature has 49 units. It has gone many modification, mostly involving which replastering and rebuilding. Basic sequence is a platform cca. 2x1.2 m square which gets gradually enlarged before a final phase when it's shortened to cca. 1.2 m square.

In the first platform was bounded by series of ovens to the east. It's enlarged in the following phase over the early ovens in the kitchen area when it lips up against oven and bin to the SW corner of space 201. When space 201 was partitioned to make spaces 86 and 158, platform was shortened and was used only in space 86.
Over all, large number of refloorings and it comes to mind that because of vicinity of kitchen area and number of oven type features the platform could have been food preparation zone. 
Platform 169 didn't have burials, although one small cut was emptied and we found out it was empty - a possible cache?

  c:description "N-E platform.
Top floor of this platform was recognized at the end of 1998 season by excavating unit 3521, under a large mass of rubble and plaster (# 3547) in the NE corner of space 86. 
The surface immediately on the top floor was excavated as unit 3551 in 1999. Organic materials and neonate (?puppy) bones were lying on the floor (towards the area under the roof collapse). The uppermost floor is flat and smooth surface, brown-grey. On top of the floor there was much fallen plaster next to the east and north walls (3570). This material was excavated as units: 3569, 3570, 3551, 3579, 3571. 
Uppermost floor (#1) is 1 cm thick layer (possibly two layers) of plaster, thicker in NE (#3521). The floor is white and slopes downa to south. It is already cut by F. 602, no artifactes in floor or packing below. 
The packing below floor #1 is grey-brown. It is thicker and slopes down towards south (# 3595) where it contained a large fragments of charcoal and a bone ring fragment. 
Floor #2 is smooth and very white plaster in south of platform becoming less hard and greyer towards north and east. The packing was removed with the floor since the floor was a quite thin layer and separated from floor #3 by several cms of packing. 
Floor #3-4 was cleaned and removed in 2000. Floor 3 coincides with putting the lid on the burial pit F. 631 and with extending the platform in a southern direction (#6253). The extension is built up over F. 170 with thick plaster layer. This is different from floor #3 in the rest of the platform. In the eastern edge this floor was cut by F. 633. In the SE it was easy to distinguish the thin layer of plaster and packing from the underlying floor #4 white plaster. In the west and east the two floors were removed together as one unit. Floor #3 tends to be uneven white, with mottling and even burned material (#6390). Floor #5 was also excavated in 2000. It was an uneven white plaster with brown grey packing below. In NE corner floor #6 slopes sharply down towards NE, so that the packing under #5 is very thick here. 
Floor #6 was first cleaned in 2000 and continued in 2001. It comprises a 1cm thick white cream-coloured plaster floor(s) and a 5 cm thick beige packing layer underneath. On the west, the floor and packing were excavated up to the small lip (#8215) that forms the boundary between F. 162 and 173. On the south side there is a continuous lip of white plaster on beige packing (#8207, 8208) that links F. 173 and 170. 
The small lip (#8215) was created on top of floor #7.
After it was removed in 2001, floor #7 and its packing was excavated. Floor #7 is 2mm thick layer of white plaster with 5 mm tan packing below. North of F. 631 floor #7 plaster is very eroded (#8249).
Floor #8

The first three deposits (units 8005, 8007 and 8018) represent a series of packing, plaster layer and packing.  These units were quite heavily eroded and all abutt wall 102 (eastern wall of building 10).  Of these deposits, 8018 abutts pillar 1308.  The first deposit to abutt a bench is 8025 and it abuts bench 1304 (the second phase of a series of three benches - I.e. 1301, 1304, and 1310), the first and latest phase of bench (1301) having sat in isolation (as left by Greek team in 1997).  Layer 8025 seemed to lip up onto a mudbricky deposit at its northern edge where it also abutted pillar 1308.  After unit 8025 had been excavated another plaster layer was revealed and the northern edge of bench 1310 appeared in its entirety (which this plaster layer abutted).  This plaster layer ran under the mudbricky deposit which 8025 seemed to lip up onto.  This mudbricky material has turned out to be the reamains of another bench (1315) - see also feature sheet 1316 for platform north of bench 1315.

NOTE:  The decision was made that units within the same platform that abutted different benches would be given different feature numbers so as to ease further discussion of phasing.  I suppose these units could be grouped in a running matrix and then given phase numbers but this decision has been made and it is too late to go through all the records to change it.  Just be aware of this decision ! 

Ideally units 8005, 8007 and 8018 should have been given a separate platform feature number according to the system above but as they are sitting in isolation having little bearing on the phasing it was deemed not to be imperative.

The walls themselves were bonded into one another, making them a single construction event, the brick elements (15776) (in wall F2624) and (17314) (in wall F.5005) were all comprised of firm cemented slightly silty sand, which was pale yellow-brown in colour. The bricks were bonded with cemented pale grey-brown slightly ashy silt, which contained occasional to moderate charcoal flecks, which averaged between 50 and 70mm thick. The walls stood to an average height of 0.4m high from the base of the cut to their final surviving height. This amounted to between 3 and 4 courses (stepping down towards the southern end of the space probably to account for the underlying slope)."^^xsd:string ;

Consisted of compacted mixed material, very much like the underlying room infill but packed to form a rectangular, upstanding feature. Only the core of packing survives, further layers, presumably including plastering episodes having been removed by Mellart.

Platform in SW corner of sp.163 truncated by prehistoric activity and mostly removed  by Mellart, except for a surviving rubble core. No apparent burial cut through it. Difficult to ascertain a function as most of the feature previously removed.

(sf dec 00) Oven 416 was a later construction which clipped the eastern edge of this platform although the platform must have continued to function throughout the lifespan of the building.

Although burial 464 was not located until after the excavation of the platform it  very likely  cut through and the realtionship has been changed accordingly. A further small cut [4402] probably cut through it too.

Because the cut of pit 440 respects the edges  of the platform it may be suggested that the pit was also an original feature and through constant use, the fills abutting the platform gave it the appearance of being later as was originally recorded."^^xsd:string ;

From 2005 Archive Report::

F.2174 is the northwestern platform of Space 94, approximately 0.15m higher than floor F.2176 and 0.3m lower than the abutting southern platform F.2177. The 1.6m square platform was built against walls F.2032 to the north and F.2106 to the west, and the plaster render (11934) was contiguous with the wall plasters. The surface of platform F.2174 appears to have been discriminately exposed to fire with only the northeastern half of it rubified and friable, while the other half was less fire exposed and similar to the heat exposure to the rest of the building and surfaces. This  differential burning pattern probably occurred because of the initial collapse of an architectural structure (11937) that protected the southwestern corner of the platform from the fire. This part of the house seems to have been quite clean, the large quantity of charcoal retrieved from the floor probably being formed in the moments of initial destruction. There were three objects on the surface (11928) of F.2174 in these last moments, a very fine stone bowl and a grinder were found one next to the other, not far from a third stone tool. All these items were severely affected by the fire, which caused the bowl to crack into many fragments."^^xsd:string ;

Seems to have been plastered with fine clay plaster which turned dark brownish black through the burning process.

It is not as highly fired as platform 2174 and floor 2176.

From Archive Report 2005 :

The slightly narrower platform F.2177 is 1.8m square and stands 0.3m higher than the platform to the north of it. This height difference is unusually high. The platform was covered by multiple layers of fine plaster (10300) which all turned dark brown-black because of exposure to very high temperatures. It seems that at least in the last moments before the house burnt down, this southern platform was a clean area. An obsidian piece (10299.x 4), and three ground stone one of which was a large flat quern-stone 10299.x1 were found on top of the platform. This large stone protected the area underneath from the fire and when lifted phytolith impressions of platform matting were revealed (10300.s1)

Addition 2013:
Started excavating the platform in 2013 by removing the bench F2021, the plaster U10300 and underlying both of them arbitrary layers of plaster and make up U20656. While removing the last unit features and activities that must have been contemporary with the lifetime of the platform were found:
-the fire spot U20658 that was on one of those layers
-the basin F7119 made by cutting the core of the platform around the beginning of its lifetime. It disappeared through subsequent replastering of the platform.
The step F7123 cut in the corner of the platform to ease the access to the platform and was plastered together with the platform.
Under the make up and plaster layers further features incorporated in the platform were found shedding a light on how it was erected:
On top of earlier platform  (with the horned bench F7118 on it) partition walls were built creating a compartment together with the bench and space wall F2006 that was then infilled creating a higher platform. Then the Feature F7316 was incorporated in that construction and the space between it, the walls of the space and the partition walls were also infilled. Lastly the remaining space E from that construction (between it and the wall F2013) was also infilled (with possible foundation/feasting event U30509 taking place during this action). The step that was existing there before (formed by part of the earlier platform) was than renewed by cutting a step in the F2177 NE corner."^^xsd:string ;

The current interpretation of this feature is that the pit was dug after the abandonment of building 1.

Platform in NW corner of space 71; it has undergone many modification, chiefly involving replastering and re-building. The basic sequence is a platform c. 1.4 m square which gradually gets  enlarged over 3 phases before a final phase where it reverts back to its original size,
At its greatest size it is c. 1.6 m square.
The principal problem is the number of replasterings on the S face vis-à-vis the E face - either the E side was truncated / shortened at some  point or the  S side was more extensibly modified. Either way, this phenomenon seems to be related to the presence of burials to the E of the platform especially burial F30. 
One possible projecting feature is associated with the platform coming out at the middle of the S face - although another may also occur in the middle of the E face (see (2102) and (2163) respectively)

Discussion:
Platform, possibly used as a sleeping area, though I know of no evidence /reason for this interpretation.
It's main contextual associations are with burials. but not all platforms had burials in (e.g. F32). It may be better to see this and other platforms in terms of the general 'raising' of floor levels, of which  there are many n building 1 - despite this, however, this was clearly a focal area, with the painted plaster and burials."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "On Mellaarts level VII plan (1964, fig 11) a post was positioned on this location. Given that a plaster scar of a former post is still visible it is likely that we are dealing with a post retrieval pit that includes cut 10803/10808 and fill 10802/10807. The feature is loacted exactly opposiste f.1703 which also seems to be a post retrieval pit.

Feature 1705 probaly cut into / disturbs burial f. 1702, in particular skeleton 10814. A skull is located at this point. It is unclear whether:
1 the skull was encountered when 1705 was cut but left in situ;
2 the skull may have been displaced and repositioned:
3 the skull may have been placed in the post retieval pit as a new element.

The fill (u. 10812) contained many plaster fragments which probably derived from the wall above or or from the post coating. No moulding plaster fragments were encountered, and the mouldings that Mellaart reconstructs on the post cannot be confirmed on this basis. 

The northern extension of the cut u. 10803 and its fill u. 10802 seem to have been overdug and do probably not relate to the true extent of f. 1705. This is probably better represented on plan 004/902.

Note 20-07-04
Investigation of feature 1705 made it clear that the cut was underdug. Most of the remaining fill (unit 10807) was removed today. Further details on 21-07-04.
21-07-04
The feature has become somewhat larger and deeper (see drawing 04/913)
It has become clear that the skull earlier believed to be located at the bottom of the feature, is in fact located within its fill. It was placed at a moment when deposition had already been taking place. Whether the skull was encountered and lifted and then put back and belongs to skeleton 10814, or alternatively, constitutes another individual, remains an unresolved issue."^^xsd:string ;

The pit is filled from the top with large pieces of brick and moulded plaster. Brick at the top in north. Cow skull/jaw fragment squashed under large plaster blob. 
20-30 cm below surface is a thick layer of red burnt material as fill. Corresponds to layer of burned soil under plaster floor of feature 173. Layer in pit is thinner than under floor. Pit is filled with large pieces of moulding plaster jammed in (don't forget - the roof collapsed on top of this feature). A large circular piece jammed in horizontally. This plaster was very carefully cleaned 5-7/08/99. Plaster was filmed in detail and removed in sequence that was deposited. Under plaster is a hole for post excavated 22/08.
The plaster infill of this pit was at first recognized to be a semiboukranion that had fallen into the pit nose forward  and had jammed. Once the plaster was removed it turned out to be amorphous lumps of moulding plaster/clay from which it was difficult to derive meaning. It seems now that it can be interpreted as plaster moulded around the post that was jammed when the post was removed. The post went down below plaster and post-retrieval pit further 20-30 cm."^^xsd:string ;

F.3320 is a mudbrick construction of unknown purpose, forming the western limit of 446. It consists of reddish-grey brick with plaster coating the on eastern and western face. No bricks visible in plan or section, where it is cut by north baulk of Trench 5.
  3320 might belong to a building phase later than 5052, 2428 and 2428, 3327 and might have cut the eastern part of those features - see also sheets for 5052 and 452. Separated frim 3335 by a gap of 1 cm. 
  It is not entirely clear whether or not 3320 is already sitting on fill in Sp. 446 - probably not, but it is only plastered above the level of floor U. 15170, which was abutting 3320.

F 3335 is seperated from 3320 by a gap of ca 1 cm width. Visibly seperated from 5052 by colour (3335 darker brick than 5052).  3334 is abutting the plaster coating that was applied on south and east face of 3335. Thus 3334 probably later than 3335.

in 1995 plaster was clinging to parts of the E-facing side (space 107) but by 1996 this had gone. On the W-facing side (space 108) substantial plaster remained at S end [1503] & the lower part of  pillar excavated by Mellaart (53) immediately south of gap; scant plaster on E side of S end on gap [1510] and good plaster on N end of gap [1509]

sf 2/9:
N-S adjacent party wall between space 108 to west and 107 to east. The 3.5 m length of the wall contains feature 55, an opening located towards the North. measuring c. 1.46 m, only 0.24 m stretch of wall exists to the North, forming a door jamb to the opening before it forms the E-W alignment north walls. Both sides of the opening are formed by vertical, but askew, and smooth faced ends, the north face was plastered with 1509 with a basal preparation of mud plaster 1549. There was little visible trace of plaster 1510 the south. Patches of plaster adhered to both east and west faces but very fragmentary. In the NW corner was a plastered pillar 54 & centrally located on the west face were remnants of a feature. That possibly is a pillar (53) Mellaart recorded in this location.
The wall comprised 10 courses of brick and 10/11 of mortar (see sections M31&32). Visual inspection suggests one brick and mortar type. The top of the wall was badly eroded, extant height unknown.
To the north the wall appears to bond with both east & west walls to spaces 107 & 108 .. .. the stub of wall north of 55 is still in situ. To the south the wall was truncated by Mellaart, the time relationship is unknown (as yet).
This wall was dismantled by Mira with many samples taken, also by Evan (conservator). The lower courses of the wall were more irregular than the upper courses, possibly represent constructed state of consolidation in situ.
To the SW a large chunk of wall contiguous with floor plaster remained intact. Taken for sampling.

Two major phases of wall use: pre-blocking 50, joined spaces 107/108 and post-blocking, resulting in 2 spaces. Its possible that features 53+54 were post-blocking and also a bench that Mellaart records in West face of blocking. This may explain why we found no post-blocking floors running up to the wall.

Discussion:
nsh 17.8:
Party wall between space 108 &107, one brick thick and plastered on both faces. Broken at N end by opening 55 which seems to be original, & was later blocked up. Therefore this wall is  in 2 parts, the major one to the S, a tiny part at N.
Lower construction may be in situ creation of foundation bricks. Superstructure seems to be one brick type & one mortar type, though the upper courses may include the base of rebuilds. Many samples taken may change this view. I was not present when lowest course was removed."^^xsd:string ;

Discussion:
A strange feature, a 'ledge' which seems too narrow to be of much use; it may seem to accentuate the vertical gradation of levels north-to-south within space 71, but it may also be a product of the wall construction which also seems to just out in the lower courses. However, this phenomenon does occur at/below floor level & the ledge merely 'masks' out this rather than following it / being a product of it.

The burial infill was artifact scarce, except for pieces of bone and a bit of obsidian around the top and pieces of shiny shell throughout the infill. About 15 centimeters down in the burial fill we came across plant material, and upon exposing more of it we ecountered bone. We attempted to expose as much of the mat as possible before removing it to get to the skeleton but that was rather difficult as the mat was very delicate and often attached to the bones. The skeleton was in the fetal position - the remains (pretty much complete) of a young child with a shell of about 3 centimeters around his/her temple."^^xsd:string ;

There is no reason to doubt that the wall either side is a single build / phase. The base is unclar due to later activity, but the floors of space 107 appear to lip up and peak c. 1/3 (or more) of the way though the gap, dropping down as a step on the W side for entry into space 107. When the gap was blocked, these floors/steps were cut [1519] to hold a make-up layer on which blocking wall 50 was built, & the preise shape of the floor of the gap is unknown.. It appears to dip at the N & S edges, which is unusual as generally floors seem to build up at edges rather than in the centre.

Discussion:
Mellaart says doorways don't exist except in the upper few levels - only crawlholes.
The plaster floors 1084 were made in one build with wall plaster 1503 at the S end of gap, though the poor state of wall plaster 1510 makes it impossible to say for certain that 1510 & 1503 were done together - though I'd say they were. 
The 'gap' seems to have been planned in the original building of wall 51, in the lowest construction courses."^^xsd:string ;

The width at top is 0.28m to north & 80 mm to south & base 0.27 to north x 0.17 m to south but these measurements reflect the erosion process & it is more likely that the width would have reflected that of the wall at the base, approx 0.40 m. Max depth to north 0.19 m x to south ca. 50 mm.
The S side of opening is very gradually sloping to ca. 70-80 degrees to the North, & the north side falls as an overhang ca. 70-80 degrees. The basal break was approx 90 degrees at the base irregular with a gradual fall from east to west. The sides are smooth but no obvious preparation to levelling to the base.

Discussion:
Opening in N-S alignment wall 57 in spaces 106 to east and 107 to west. At some phase, the two spaces were interlinked, what the opening represents is uncertain, it is very unlike opening 55 in space 107 and 108 in size and treatment. This could be a crawl hole but it appears quite high from the wall base ca 0.40m to the west & ca. 0.50 m from the east face. As we don't know the height of the floors in space 106 neither in 107 (check in DB). One possibility is that it represents a window."^^xsd:string ;

Buttress consists of dark grey brick, pale yellow mortar (at least seven lines of mortar and 9 layers of bricks are visible in cut of 3331) with thick white plaster. No bricks visible in plan. A thick layer of plaster separates 3302 from 2427. Thus 3302 was built against 2427. The wall juts out here a bit, thus probably planned to meet the buttress.
Upper part (ca.20cm) of 3302 removed in 2010 for stability (truncation).

(KTX - 19/08/12) - This feature is the eastern, smaller buttress of B.106, which is connected to wall F.2427 in the interior. It was built above a white plastered layer (U.16999), as was wall F.2427. Above this a large slab of lighter mudbrick formed the base of the buttress, covering the entire surface. From thereon, 6 courses of brick were identified, of which the upper two sloped upwards in order to compensate the uneven substrate/base. The brick courses were smaller than the larger base brick and most likely a double-row of brick placed at right angles at wall F.2427. The upper courses of brick bonded directly to the inner part of F.2427, proving both features are contemporenous. At some point in time this buttress, along with F.3301 in the West, as features of this upper building, formed a separation between  sp.310 in the North and sp. 454 in the South."^^xsd:string ;

Discussion:
Feature 95 is an opening in the southern wall of space 113. It was eventually blocked - (2098)/(2099) but then re-opened - cut [2095] at which time a floor/surface/lining (2094) accumulated/was laid before it was blocked again - (2092)/(2093). One possibility is that it was originally a doorway to the south which was then blocked, possibly when the wall directly to the south F67 was built. At a later point it was partially re-opened as a niche with plaster at the rear. The blocked doorway location was presumably selected for the niche because the blocking was obviously non-structural and not supporting anything."^^xsd:string ;

The juvenile had 5 rings on one hand. Much use of Ochre; also grey pigment  and organic residues such a phytoliths and probable wood stains.

Discussion:
This is complex. The shape and orientation of cut 2117, together with the fact that is was discovered below the lowest floors, and that skeleton 2115 can only be accommodated within cut 2117, argues for a single large N-S cut containing two E-W cuts in its base to receive 2 skeletons as a double inhumation. If one was buried first, it must be the juvenile, as the adult's knee was raised high on the ridge. although it is possible that 2117 was simply not recognised from higher up, there is no question that these are the earliest burials, nor that 2115 & possibly 2119 - could only fit into this large cut. The skeletons are in practically identical positions, & look as though they could have been put in together - though appearances can deceive. Careful examination failed to provide conclusive evidence either way, and my best guess is the one provided above - a dingle large pit with 2 smaller ones at the base, to provide the normal close-fitting hole. No sign of disturbance of either skeleton."^^xsd:string ;

The feature is a one-and-a-half-brick thick wall that was made up of mid brown – light orange mud bricks with more or less equal silt and sand content. The difference between the bricks and the mortar was clear, the later having mid-grey colour and including organic material.

From Archive Report 2007:

The abandonment phase of Space 17 was represented by an oval post retrieval pit F.2822. The pit (15051) contained a primary soft brown fill (15082), a secondary dark grey fill (15072), and a final fill loose ashy fill (15050). All three fills contained significant quantities of charcoal, animal bone and fire-cracked rocks. There was however, no evidence of in-situ burning and this material was re-deposited, possibly from a cooking installation. The bone did not consist of the large, high yield limbs normally associated with ‘feasting’ deposits, but this feature does appear to have been deliberately deposited. This impression is
reinforced by the presence of a large horn core, 15036.X1, directly on top of the tertiary fill.

The post retrieval pit was sealed by firm mid brown clay silt (15036) with frequent crushed mud brick inclusions, which possibly represents the backfilling of Space 17. This was in turn sealed by the same loose excavation spoil (15015), which was recorded in Trench 1."^^xsd:string ;

Discussion:
Large pit in north-west corner of space 154. The exact top was not identified but it seems to have been cut late on during the infilling of building 5 just prior to the construction of building 1. as nothing was deposited in it, it was presumably for the retrieval of something either structural or artefactual. IT seems an unlikely position for something structural but analysis of the bone/Heavy Residue etc. failed to find any evidence about what had been removed.

Two circular cuts were seen - in the north-west (larger) and norht-east corners, both partly lined with plaster.
Whether these were 'flues' of some kind or fire-pits later cut into the oven structure is uncertain. The former had no clear evidence of burning but a scorched ashy deposit lay in front of it (to the north); the latter  contained some charcoal and was associated with a small quantity of obsidian flakes, and a blade.

Recorded in the field as an oven but reassessed in post ex as an hearth based on location which was essentially not against the south wall.

  c:description "1997 SF:
NS aligned wall, party wall on 109 to west and 112 to east. Abutted at its southern terminus by EW aligned wall 52 which forms the south wall to the space. Wall 52 follows the south terminus around the dog leg to the south and the south west end. Therefore wall 267 is earlier than wall 52. 267 continues north beyond the limit of the Mellaart Area trench. Its eastern face is rendered with multiple plaster applications and a floor horizon abutting the wall face. In the SW corner, it is abutted by platform 86. A second construction phase of this wall is represented by  wall 85. which cut into the SE corner face of wall 267 which presumably functioned as a bond, wall 85 was constructed over platform 86 on an EW alignment, the east face of wall 267 was therefore in use through these two phases as only the south and west walls were 'revetted' or re-revetted. To the west, the face of wall for space 109 is plastered (2834) which actually pre-dates the southern wall of space 109 therefore the implication is that wall 267 extended or was part of another wall further south but removed in antiquity. This sequence is arrived at because the south wall of space 109 (it is represented by wall 52), abuts the plastered west face of this wall. So, if we take wall 52 as the south wall of this space 109, wall 267 forms the east wall and again this is only because the west face is plastered. However, both the south and east walls were abutted by later walls for space 109. Abutting the west face of 267 was wall 94 and to the south was wall 98, both of which were bonded. There was no activity horizon associated with wall 267 which may have been cleared out, alternatively and more feasible is that  wall 52 was the north wall for spaces 106,107, and 108 to the south, wall 267 was a re-used west wall for space109, the plastered face to the west was there fore an earlier association and nothing to do with space 109 and part of the walls for 109 were represented by walls 94 and 98.
Wall 267 has not been completely excavated this year and we won't know the complete  picture until it is. It's bee shaved down because of fairly steep overhang which won't survive until 1998. Therefore this wall needs to be planned again at the  and the relationships to the earlier walls (not numbered but below 94) should be established.

1998: Bricks 7.5 YR 3/1 very dark grey. mortar mottled 

1998 JB: Wall F267 was fully excavated during 1998. The top part (c.0.50 m thick) proved to be somewhat different from the lower part, i.e. top was less wide, c. 25 cm, abutted rather than bonded to wall F286 and the bricks were slightly more pale brown but otherwise the same size and the same type of mortar was used. The lower part extended continuously and was c.37 cm wide at the base, as was further indicated by the concave shape of the wall seen in the N section of space 112. The lower part was also bonded to wall 286, which would mean that the upper  part of wall 267 is actually later in date. The bricks in the lower part were of a stronger colour, yellowish brown. The base was distinct, easy to follow with very dark grey bricks and mottles mortar which survives in places (brown, white and grey), very uneven and irregular surface at base and the underlying wall slopes even more from North to South than 267, and again seems to be bonded with new wall in SW junction, underlying F286. The wall underlying F267 appears to abut the wall below F94 to the W, as did the lowest part of F267 at the SW end, the NW part between 267 and wall underlying 90 is infilled.

7/9/98 SF: Update on wall 267 - Shahina
Firstly, last year was that wall 52 represented the early southern wall to space 112, later abutted by a support wall 85. This was found to be wrong this year, in that the southern boundary for space 112 pre 'support' wall 85 was represented by wall 286. this was bonded to the yellow brown bricks of wall 267, therefore as Jenny records the upper courses only of 267 in the SW corner, were abutted by wall 286. The fact that at this junction there was plaster on the east facing top course of wall 267 results in a circular stratigraphical relationship. I need to think more on this, but it could be totally misleading as is was all so dry and fragmentary. More on this when I have time to think!
Although there is no hard evidence (which may reveal itself in section some time in the future) it appears that in fill of the earliest building took place after the construction of the wall.

Note 20-07-2004 by Bleda During
In the 2004 campaign the northern part of space 112 (and the room to the north space 231) were excavated. On the basis of these excavations the following elements can be added to the feature sheet.

The wall measures about 3.20 meters from the 1997 section to the north corner, its maximum height in this strectch is about 80 cms. The width of the bricks is about 20 cms, but mah have been wider at the bottom where the wall is less eroded. Bricks are between 10 and 4 cms high and are often difficult to outline (see drawing 004/907). The matrix is a compact orange bricks with lime particles and small vegetal inclusions. Mortar is generally about 2 to 4 cms. It consists of greyish compact clay with the same inclusions as the bricks. 

It has been suggested (see above) that there was a distinction between the upper part of 267 and its lower courses in terms of brick matrices. In our part of the building this distinction merely seems to reflect the fact that the upper part of the wall has been exposed to the environment whereas the lower part has not, given that the differences occur exactly at the point where Mellaart ended his excavations.

In terms of relations to other features the following elements can be noted. Wall f.267 was built on earlier wall f. 295 (west wall space 162 - level VIII). This wall can be recognized on the basis of its dark grey very compact bricks. This wall f. 295 slopes down steeply to the south.

Wall f. 267 is bonded to the north wall of the building incorporating space 112 and 231, wall f. 1700, which has similar bricks and mortar. The plaster on both walls is also continuous.

Wall f. 267 is abutted by the internal division wall f. 1701 to the east, but the plaster on both walls is continuous, and there is no plaster at the interface of the two walls.

Post retrieval pit 1703 was cut along wall f. 267. There was no plaster scar of the former post on the wall.

A plastered niche f. 1708 was constructed within and cut out of the northern part of wall f. 267, and then lined with red clay and beige plaster.

The walls relation to wall f. 94 along this stretch is not clear. No consistent plaster coating could be recognized along the interface (unlike to the south where 267 had a plaster coatıng and was abutted by f. 94- see above), but excavation of f. 267 may clarify the relation between the two walls.

Equally the relation of wall f. 267 to the neighbouring wall of building VII.20 cannot be established at present. No plaster was recognized at the interface between the two walls."^^xsd:string ;

Doorway between spaces 150 and 151

1998: SF
Upon further investigation it was found that wall / buttress 99 was a later  addition abutting wall 263 and so the doorway 250 at the late phase was 0.64 m wide at the earlier phase was c. 1.0 m wide. The reason for a narrowing is uncertain, possibly it represented a support buttress wall 263 has quite a steep overhang in space 151. The doorway was eventually blocked (units 2314) This was originally believed to have taken place post-use of the building, prior to infilling of building 4 and blocked to avoid subsidence and generally as a structural support for later building activity. The blocking was carefully and well done which seems to be at odds at his infilling stage.
Another interpretation is that space 150 was blocked off at the time when FI 252 was constructed through wall  97. The 'dome' of 252 was constructed in space 150 and it is possible that the space was then no longer used and blocked and infilled which may then suggest explain the care in blocking the doorway.
As the floors were badly scoured in space 151 post-use there was no stratigraphical evidence to link or support this interpretation."^^xsd:string ;

At the north end the wall stood 13 cm west of (inside) the south face, had a plaster face (2746) surviving about 0.2 m high as initially revealed (though it goes much further) and was composed of indistinct bricks of something like type C - because of poor visibility bricks and mortar removed together as 2750.

1998: This was fully excavated in 1998 + caused endless problems. Last year it was thought to be a continous E wall to space 112, as a later support addition abutting the main wall 259. However as was recorded last season, the S half of the wall was composed of different brick type to the N half. This was because the S half of the wall was the only later addition abutting wall 259. The N half was part of wall 259. To the S wall 253 was cut into the top of wall 286. The W bound S wall of space 112. To the N it continues beyond the trench area. Wall 259 slopes mainly westwards which accounts for the need of a support wall 253. It abutts the late support wall 85 to the S. The strange thing is that when 253 was removed it revealed wall plaster + floor horizons adhering to the wall face behind. This is an anomally as it implies that floors overlay the earlier wall 259. Which does not quite work. Indeed it does not make sense at all, it implies that another building was present of which this wall and floor plaster is the only survival and indiaction (SF)."^^xsd:string ;

The following discussion is based on the excavation of the northern 1/3 of this wall excavated in 2004. This is the east wall to spaces 112 and 231 (northern room of this building).

In the extant part of the wall it is up to ten courses high. The bricks are an orange compact and greasy clay matrix, the mortar is a grey compact clay. Bricks are about 26 cms wide and about 5 cms high and maybe some 72 cms long. The mortar between the bricks is about 2-3 cm high. The bricks seem to have been laid in alternating layers.
The structure of the wall is extremely difficult to see in freshly exposed parts of the wall, where the outline of bricks and mortar can often not be traced. By contrast those parts of the wall that have been exposed for a longer period are much clearer, It seems that drying affects the mortar and brick matrices differentially and makes them easier to separate.
The wall is plastered on both its eastern ans western face (interior space 112). The plaster on both ends consists of finely laminated beige white plaster layers, but the plaster coating in about 1 cm on the east face but ranges up to 3-4 cm on the western surface. The fact that the east surface is plastered might imply either that the wall served as a party wall at some point or that we are dealing with an external plastered wall. Certainly it implies that the wall (f.90?) to the east is later than f. 259.
Wall f. 259 was founded on wall 298, the east wall of space 162, of level 8. This foundation slopes down steeply from north to south, over a distance of some 3 meters (part excavated in 2004) the vertical difference amounts to about 80 cms. In the central part of the wall, near where the northern of the two posts was originally placed, the wall has a large overhang to the west (to the north the wall is more or less vertical), presumably due to pressure from deposits to the east. Unlike in the southern part of space 112 (where wall 253 was put in front of 259 at some point in mid sequence) no extra support walls were found in the part of the building excavated in 2004.
Wall 259 is bonded to 1700, which is the north wall of the building. The bricks and mortar of the two walls are completely identical. In the north of the wall, in space 231, a large niche, f. 1706, was cut out of the wall and plastered. Despite this feature the wall is still more or less vertical in this area, unlike to the south. For some reason the pressure on this stretch of the wall seems to have been much less than to the south. Post retrieval pit 1705 was dug next to the wall, to remove the northern of the two posts, whose plaster scar was still visible on the wall. The posts may have been removed mid-occupation, like the ones to the south (Farid South Area chapter).
      


NB a small section of wall 259 was kept in place in order to support the overhanging wall (f.90?) to east which would otherwise collapse."^^xsd:string ;

Skeleton located at interface of quite obvious change and deposition from fine ashy lenses to larger dumps of more clayey matrix but also of rubbish debris type. The burial was clearly an unusual event to take place in this so called external area - in a non-burial context which raised a number of questions on why this particular individual was not buried in a house. Questions in whether the individual had been an outcast, an outsider, a disfigured individual, even invader victim (into the realms of fantasy). The change of deposition type may be significant; the overlying deposits interfaced as secondary 'dump' deposits, being of a mixed nature with all the elements of 'midden' and similar in appearance and probably contemporary 
with the infilling of space 117. The crucial change is represented by surface 3181 which definitely sealed the burial. The cut was larger than the space of the skeleton which occupied it, the empty space located to the NW of the cut which may have been due to the burial replacement, e.g.. not placed in the cut carefully or squarely. This may suggest therefore that the body was placed in a wrapping or container. The location of the hands and feet could also suggest some form of binding which would also occur if placed in a container/basket but there was no visible evidence for either binding or basket.

The unusual posture of the skeleton is apparently the result of post-burial dislodging as interpreted by reconstruction drawing done by Lucy and Theya."^^xsd:string ;

Next, a deposit of various materials layered vertically was built on to the S (3901). Finally a long thick stripe of plaster was added running from N to S from the central NS divide of the space 117 (3905). This could have been built up with the floor layers which were laid down within the area it contained to the W, but did not appear to be layered, so probably was not. It seems as a whole to represent a change in the use of the space. Possibly the end of the use of F.269/F.293 to the E and the beginning of the use of F.290 to the W. This is supoported by the changing extent of the floor and floor deposit layers above and beneath F.289, although the material that these were made up of does not seem to have changed."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "F. 3379 was defined in 2013 by removing fill on top of it, north of it (sp. 446) and south of it (sp. 452). It consists of yellowish material applied in thick layers (\"brick\") and darker, thinner layers (\"mortar\").
F. 3379 might be identical to F. 3330 (one wall), but that can not be verified because the tent is standing on this connection. Both walls have the same material and similar outlines.

F. 3379 has a stepped top, which is in part result of excavation, but partially the actual top off it. It seems to have been cut for F. 3320 to be built- when F. 3320 was removed in 2012, the corner of F. 3367 and F. 3379 (probably are construction, because some material) appeared directily underneath. Also, F. 3321 seems to have been built onto cut F. 3379.
F. 3379 was abut by several of the floors in sp. 446.
F. 2428, F. 3324, F. 3335 are made from different material than F. 3379, and this probably belong to a different phase of cunstrution.

The idea that F. 3379 might be a later construction than the cob walls mentioned before is based on the observation that F. 3379 is made from same material as the buttresses in B. 127, which abut F. 3324"^^xsd:string ;

Unfortunately the exact outlines of this wall are difficult to define. It is only dearly visible when cutting into it to find brick and mortar. It seems that the western, facade of this wall is slightly further inwards (west) than that of F. 3344. The facade of F. 3378 seems irregular (preservation?), especially at the bottom where it might be standing on fill or curving inwards heavily.

This feature was nicely plastered (U.20628, ca.2cm depth) in its whole extension. After removing U.20628 a complicated picture of platform construction and re-modelling appeared. 
The NE of the platform was composed of a coarse make-up/infill matrix and associated clay ridge that appears to have served to increase the length of the platform for it to meet the N wall of the space. 
Inmediately to the S of this unit lies U.20948, a thick plaster edge containing a brown silty clay sediment in its central part, possibly part of a repairement episode of the platform. 
The rest of the platform consists of U.20944, a finer make-up/infill than that of units 20940 or 20948. This unit is composed of patches of different sediment types: red clay, grey mortar-like materials, burnt sediment (in situ) and plaster, all of the intermixed. The thick patches of plaster occur mostly around the edges of the platform in an irregular pattern, probably representing repairement episodes.
Other materials, such as the mudbrick and the thick plaster fragment of U.20996 appear to have been dumped into the platform feature during construction, their function/role being not clear. 
Under the layer of make-up U. 20944 lied a series of up to six clean grey floors with their respective make-ups. These have been grouped into two units (20952 and 20978) of three floors each. 
The NE corner od this feature is characterised by the concentration of reddish clay packing it shows, possibly related to the construction of the N. wall F.3681."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "This feature combines the cut, midden infill, and additional fill layer of a cut into the western wall. The cut has some plastering around the edges and was originally interpreted as a niche. After completing excavation, it appears more likely that this feature is the scar from the removal of an installation in the wall. This was concluded due to the cut's uneven back, with a jumble of mortar toward the north and plastering toward the south. A plastered animal bone was removed in the fill (u.20807) may have been related to the reconstruction of the scar before it was filled. The bone from u20807 may also be related to or contemporary with u.19227, which was a bone cluster excavated in the house's room fill in 2010. The bone cluster and the F.7005 are partially above a pit (F.7000) with bone that may also be contemporary."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "F. 3948 is an emerging wall in the center of trench 3, most recognizable by the burning evident on its S face. Its eastern extent is extremely difficult to discern, likely due to the erosion we see often on this area of the mound. The bricks appear regular, suggesting this wall may be late in date like f. 3951. Unexcavated at end of 2012 season. F. 3948 runs E-W but turns a corner at its Western end.

2013: We have excavated the fill of building 120, and have revealed the extent of f.3948. We now see that it was once plastered but has been greatly damaged by a burning event that seems to have been either intentional or at least the cause of the building's abandonment. It has been built along the terracing cut [30229], and has been built onto-- two bins abut it (f.3993 and f.7151). It has also been cut into by both a pit (f. 3986) and a robber's trench (f. 3987) which postdate the construction of the building. This wall is extremely long, and its bricks were packed into terracing cut [30229], which was an extremely irregular cut into orange Neolithic (?) mud-brick material. The plaster on this wall suggests a post-Neolithic construction date, and the vessels found on the associated floor f.7153 may be Iron Age or Bronze Age in date, but may be Roman instead."^^xsd:string ;

5. This is made by silt clay, but there are small charcoal pieces in it.
There was very little material (bone, obsidian, etc.) between the floors.
Close to the fence, we found a bone density in the upper levels. Human bones specialist basak boz said that \"they were human bones\". We found them just on the border of the road. So, if there were a burial it might be destroyed by road.

The relative undisturbance of the burial suggests this is one of the later additions to the platform, although F.3615 seems to be above this feature. Skull 20684 may actually have been placed with the flexed individual sk.20683. Several beads were found in the center of the burial and eventually more beads of different shapes and materials (copper, stone, bone and shell) and also a small whitish stone and a presumed stalactite. The stalactite had a cavity and several small stone beads fell out of it. These items may have been placed within a leather pouch, as evidenced by the brown organic matter surrounding them, which was sampled. Many beads - small black ones - were found by the vicinity of the cranium of sk.20683. The skeleton (20683) rested upon an oranges material which is thought to be associated with the burning of bodily material. 

The cut of the burial was not very distinct, although it does appear to be circular in plan and incorporates cranium 20684 to its boundary. 

Cranium 20684 had not other bones associated with it (including single rooted teeth) and its possible placement within the cut makes us believe that sk.20683 was buried with it."^^xsd:string ;

F.3338 probably was so fragmented that it was not recognized during excavation.

  c:description "This feature was discovered and defined during the last days of 2012's excavation. Unfortunately the southern part of it was removed before the feature as a whole was fully discovered. In plan the extent of the hearth is therefore only visible in plan for the cut (20695). During the start of this year's (2013) excavations the hearth was excavated, with trowel and planned in scale 1:10. The feature was excavated in plan. 

It had a quite nice rectangular shape in plan, which was kept until the last two layers of the feature (20693-20692). Seemingly the feature was cut into a lower platform and its middle even down in the layer beneath. It consists of three make-up layers (including wall however in this discussion) and four burnt fill layers. Before each make-up being lain, the burning residue was swept away, leaving only these (almost) lenses with no material in them except burnt soil and clay, in some cases charcoal.

My interpretation is that the hearth was initially round in shape (20692, 20693) but was renewed with make-up and designed to a rectangular shape (20641 and up). The bigger walls (20639) was replastered with 20630 but maintained its rectangular shape until it was ultmately abandoned. 20633 and 20630 should in that case represent the hearth's last usage phase. 

It has a relation to oven 7101 to the south, which however is not clear because of some soil being removed during 2012. Even if the oven is built probably earlier, there is however a relation visible in the trench section still. The lower platform, which this hearth was cut into, seems to have been built/lain around the oven, when still visible. In that case, at some point, they were contemporary."^^xsd:string ;

We decided to join all units in Feature (7124) because of stratigrafical sequency of the layers to use. But it's possible that the two last units should be in a separate Feature.

Below the last burnt layer (u.20995) there is probably a floor. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to check if this is true and how the relation is to the hearth next to it (F.3692).

Two last units were cut by a cut, probably for a pillar (f.7131). This feature also cut a layer below but was not visible in layers above."^^xsd:string ;

A small rectangular platform with a hard baked surface on it standing 5cm above floor 140.  The vertical east side of platform (the only side yet exposed) preserves traces of red paint.  The platform is made of relatively soft red black soil which is covered by white plaster.  Three recoatings of white plaster are visible.  its south part seems to under oven 111

Post-Ex 2010 RR: 
Hearth F.1328/F.145
The primary formal hearth within the building phase was plinth hearth, F.1328, that was attached to the north-east corner Platform F.1314.  The hearth was rectangular in shape and measured 0.52m north-south by 0.38m east-west standing 5cm above the floor to the east

The 1997 excavataion of this area reported traces of red pigment on the east face of the hearth sides but these were not apparent when the area was reopened in 2003."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "This feature consists of one cut and one fill which connected with the use of it (10245 cut and 10242 charcoal on bottom and sides). The presence of two very different upper fills (10240 South and 10241 North) might indicate the following scenario:

The hearth (or oven) in its use was a cut in the ground with a semicircular cover in elevation in the area where the fill 10240 was present, this fill being the result of collapse of the upper structure. The content of the fill (burnt daub and stones) indicate this. Where fill 10241 was present might have been fireing chamber, possibly with no cover. The thicker balyer of charcoal and ash on the bottom might argue for that, as well as the burnt clay plastering on the sides, more present in that area. In this scenario, fill 10241 (clean clay) would be an intentional careful filling of the firing chamber.

Priority toutists' feedback on the feature: 
-first they said 10240 is part of the construction and has no food remains in it.
- subsequently they identified some food remains that might indicate cooking activity but also some already digested bits ?!?

These things may still be athe result fo the oven in use (maybbe part of fill 10242) while 10240 is the upperstructure of the feature. 

Mira: the fragments of daub seemed to her to be burnt all around, so she thought they might have been \"heated stones\" rather than collapsed upperstructure (when they would be burnt on just one side). She said she wasn't very sure though. 

My view: The small fragments of daub (some of them) could have been part of the inner side of the cover, case in which they would be burnt all over."^^xsd:string ;

This heavily burnt material partly overlay an ashy rake-out layer (4808), which was clearly related to use of the feature. Below this were the truncated remains of a very hard burnt base (4901). This was not however the lowest layer of the feature, as below this lay more burnt fill (4904), which lay within a cut for the feature [4906]. This in turn had cut through an earlier superstructure (4908), a small section of which survived on the eastern side of the feature. The fire installation had therefore seen at least two, if not three phases of use, though because of truncations the full phasing was not totally clear. As with F502 the truncation was so severe that it was impossible to interpret the upper structure. It appears though, that this feature was also more likely to have been a hearth rather than an oven."^^xsd:string ;

No plaster was associated with the feature, nor was there any ash or material indicative of a FI.

The sides however were fairly pristine apart from the western edge that had been damaged by an animal burrow and the construction of a later foundation the weight of which might have caused some of the slumping the mortar7plaster coating is similar to that used along the working surfaces sen in oven F. 2090 and is coarser than that covering the surrounding floors and platforms.

Hearths F.2061 & F.2075
Placed on top of hearth surface (12820) and no doubt deliberately left there was grindstone fragment (12805), this again a repeated pattern that we shall return too. The removal of the upper hearth plaster revealed levelling demolition deposits (12833/12837) these in turn sealing the lower hearth sequence F.2075. Reflecting the oven sequence the lower hearth had two phases as represented by plaster surface and make-up, respectively (12844) and (12845) that sealed burnt hearth floor and plaster walls (12850) and (12851).

The bottom of the pit is arbitrarily level with the bottom of pit f.7188 which cuts into pit f.7191. Because a mud-brick wall was found in the bottom of pit f.7188, we assumed a change in depositional context had occurred in the fill and thus the basal boundary of the pit had been reached. This reasoning, along with a change in soil color (to more orange) in the S corner of f.7191 allowed us to settle on a basal boundary. The discovery of copper in pit f.7191 indicates that it is at least Chalcolithic in date. The pit was excavated using trowel, mattock, and brush."^^xsd:string ;

The excavation of it 2013 stopped after two units in the fill of the base, namely the massive clay fill and a floor-like layer. Beneath, not touched, lies another clay fill. It seems this very compact, hard layer (the floor-like layer) has accumulated during some time and actually might represent when the post was replaced/not present.

F1521 is a properly constructed short wall and not just extra materials used to help backfill trench [11345]. Its location within this cut and in NE corner of building suggests it may have a structural purpose. Either that of a post pad, although no evidence of post or post hole through platform F1501, so may have changed their minds? Alternatively it could have been an attempt to strengthen this corner of this building as it was constructed on a midden.

Also the NE part of the hearth is damaged or might it be the opening of it??? The side walls of the hearth can be trced but just the bottom-most part of them is preserved.

2006 - After realising that the removal of floor layers from F.2129 had released layers on hearth F.2122, a number of layers from the hearth were excavated. An attempt was made to match the plaster and packing layers on the lip of the hearth with the burnt layers on the hearth surface itself. However, the hearth was badly truncated - at the upper levels - and this proved difficult to accomplish. It became clear that layer 13251 was a distinct, white layer that seemed to extend around the hearth lip and (at least partially) across the surface. This layer also has patches of red paint showing on the outside edges. It became clear, however, that this layer could not be fully revealed until plaster layer 13265 and packing layer 13249 above 13251 were removed - and these could not be removed as they were stratigraphically later than the dirty floor surfaces on platform F.2128 - which lapped up against the hearth. This layer should be the first target of further excavation.

Unit 13245 was removed which appeared to be a lump of material used to repair damage on the NE corner of the hearth - where this repair fits in the sequence is not clear.

Blocking wall made up of up to 7 courses of brick and 8 layers mortar, on top packing or consolidation layer of thick, hard clay mortar with some pieces of brick. This was set onto a shallow slot cut in the underlying floors/step in the gap/doorway, presumably to key it in. 
Towards the top, the wall has been keyed into the S wall it abuts, by removing part of the upper  2 or 3 bricks (top very eroded) to enable the upper bricks to extend into the adjacent wall 51 for stability. The plaster on the N end of 51, lining the opening, was largely removed before blocking took place, perhaps as part of the keying-up process. The plaster on the N end of the doorway survives through the tickness of the wall and no keying-in is obvious, although the top surviving course may have extended beyond the plaster.
(Fabric of wall described as [1086], all as one, no separate bricks and mortar, also in sections 31 and 32 with separate bricks and mortar.

Discussion:
This is a blocking wall in a gap in the N-S wall between spaces 107 and 108. The gap has plastered edges and the floors appear to have run through - the step arrangement is not yet clear. It appears to me - & Wendy & David Jenkins - that the upper courses are stepped slightly to allow them to be keyed into the existing brickwork, above the top of the plaster lining the gap South. Shahina feels the upper part of the wall is too eroded for this decision to be made, and that we may be falsely iterpreting the bricks. The blocking was sectioned on 11/8 and the northern part removed, and Wendy took microstrat samples which showed the step up from 108 to 107. However, this has not been clarified, she also sampled a brick, as did Mira."^^xsd:string ;

from Archive Report 2007:

In the north-west of the trench, set on to floor surface (15930), was a partially exposed oven F.2912, consisting of three units (Figure 25): The oven wall (15917), measuring 0.85m east-west by 0.78m north-south and c.0.11m high within the L.O.E where the wall were c.0.10m thick, was constructed with firm mid brownish grey sandy silt. The primary fill (15922), concreted, dark brownish black, laminated sandy
silt, measured 0.66m E-W by 0.72m N-S by c.30mm thick (within the L.O.E). (15922) was directly underlying the secondary fill (15905), a compact, mid to dark brownish grey, laminated sandy silt, measuring 0.80m east-west by 0.70m N-S and c.30mm thick (within the L.O.E). The oven had been partially demolished in
preparation the subsequent occupation phase. It is likely that the replacement oven and/or hearth is located to the south or south-west of the foundation trench (see below)."^^xsd:string ;

The eastern 'wall' was sealed by a remnant of plaster floor (14819) although excavation of this floor showed it to be a little ambiguous, and it may not somply interpreted as the basal interface of the overlying oven f.2701, nevertheless since no other floors had been ID'd, associated with this structure (all of the other floors expected at this level had been scoured out or where never there to being with).

The hearth was finally filled with an ashy laminate comprising thin bands of grey, white and black ash. Black being the dominant colour ( many of the lenses can still be seen in section in the southern LOE). This fill was so similar to those id'd in the overlying oven F,2701, that it was partially excavated as the same-suggesting continuity of use, even though the form may change significantly.

1997: A major east-west wall separating row of spaces 109/112/113 to North from spaces 107/108/115 to the south. The wall has two returns to the south between 107/108 and 107/106 which are bonded in and has a kink in its alignment where spaces 109/112 meet. Obviously an important wall related to a largish building to the south and also possibly linked to terracing.
Partially excavated 1997 (CC).

Not fully excavated 1998 either, however only basal courses left. Wall 52 is one continous construction forming N wall to spaces 107 + 108 which at Mellaart's level VII formed one building with with doorway 50 linking the two spaces. To the E its terminus was bound to the S return wall 57 in spaces 106 + 107.To the W of the space divide for 107/108 it formed a short ?? return which formed the doorjamb for doorway 50. It continues westwards beyond the limit of excavation. The S wall associated with it was wall 270. Wall 52 was constructed over midden and therefore represented a re-development in a previously 'abandoned' area. It was, however, constructed over packing/make up material that presumably created a stable base. At the corner of walls 57 + 51, where they bonded 52, there were shallow cuts interpreted as structural/foundation cuts as consolidation at the load bearing corners. The fills of these cuts were solid clayey fills cut into soft ashy deposits of the midden. The wall slopes down from E to W, gradually stepping down to follow the slope of the mound, the terracing that Mellaart recorded too. Interestingly, the floors associated with spaces 107 + 108 also sloped down. The area was not levelled but a packing material was put down. It is not clear at this stage whether wall 52 pre- or post dated spaces 109 + 112 to the N. Whilst excavating, the S wall of space 112, wall 256, it appeared to be that wall 52 post dated 256 because of the heavy slant to wall 286 towards the S. This however is an interpretation, not a stratigraphic relationship. A clearer picture may be revelaed when the wall that appears to be an eastward continuation of wall 286 is excavated as this might reveal a stratigraphic relationship because of walls 282 + 283 (SF).

Continuation of the side walls of the dire installation suggest that it was reaching to the south wall.

Removal of the fills within the feature also showed us that several stages of repair or preparation activities took a place within this feature. Especially combination of the greenish clay material and the one side smooth and burnt oven remnants suggests that even [possibly this feature repaired at least once immediately after its roof collapsed. Or this can be entirely related to the floor which right above of it.(4779) The greenish clay have been applied in order to stabillize the collapse material and and bond or compact it in its place. Remnants inside the feature also suggest that the fire installation was domed type one which was also discovered in the building 17 (charlie's house) However, some of the repair works are also traceable from the E wall of the hearth. The collapsed material (earliest collapse) goes over the East wall and the wall repaired and raised a little more.On the E the wall which is built up against the wall still standing and used by F549 as well as F557, actually it is belong to F557.This concludes that the both feature used by same people and they are contemporary.Besides that show continuity for cooking activity in thisarea.

1562 removed to S of section revealed that 1560 is essentially built on different levels E and W and that unlike 1562 it doesn't reach slot filled by 1558 + 1556 but instead 1565 mortar fills the gap.

This is best explained either as indicating the making-up and levelling of slumped brick courses or the filling-in of some kind of niche.

Two types of brick, [1615] + [1618].

Oven F2090
The oven within the building was well preserved with a portion of the roof surviving above the entrance (Fig. 79). The sequence of use and construction was fairly straightforward but long, so a brief summary is presented here from latest to earliest. The oven had been partially demolished, this material sealing a charcoal/use deposit (13373), this lay above the only floor of the oven floor (14074). Another deposit within the oven worth mentioning was stone packing deposit (14078) set under compact mortar (14077). The incorporation of the stones was possibly for heat retention, however, if these stones had been were found in any other context we would be calling it a special deposit but here there presence would appear functional. Removal of the oven along with floor (13380) revealed the base of an earlier oven F.2600, this partially cut into wall F.2509."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "The interface between the clean infilling and the overlying debris was clear and sharp created by a large truncation horizon (18134) cut on a gradual slope. From the south the cut began some 0.2-0.3m in from the south wall and cut at a roughly 45 degree angle to a central depth of c.0.7m and rising up slightly to the north where it ran up to the north wall on a relatively even plane. At this end a cut event was less clear as the subsequent deposits lay directly against the heavily plastered wall face faithfully following the uneven contours. The only indication of a cut suggested by a basal area of mudbrick and large fragments of plaster perhaps an indication of displacement as the cut faithfully followed the internal wall face of the building. The cut was just short of 5.0m, the entire length of Sp.63 but its width extended beyond the trench LOE, it may be assumed though that the cut may have extended over the entire room. This exercise would have provided a rich source of clean clay silt from the infill and as such interpreted as a quarrying event. 

 An initial infilling was represented by a dump of midden and rubble material (15694), which as excavated was indistinguishable from the overlying fill (15656) but in section it was a relatively thick up to 0.3m deposit at the sides, thinning towards the centre as it settled. These were differential dumps with diffuse boundary interfaces of mixed mid brown, orange and grey, crushed building rubble mixed with midden components and bands of pale grey ash rich deposits mixed with plaster and charcoal fragments all of which appeared to be redeposited rather than primary accumulation. 

Cutting this horizon was a pit cut (15677) sub circular in shape approximately 1.4m in diameter and 0.44m deep with steep undercut sides and flat base. The fill  (15676) was not dissimilar to the underlying deposit an ashy, midden rich fill with some burnt brick rubble and charcoal. Towards the top at the interface of the overlying deposit were some larger brick fragments that were weathered, rolled and worn indicating that the brick rubble component was clearly redeposited again containing quantities of animal bone, stone and obsidian. The necessity for a second cut is puzzling, perhaps more clean clay was needed and the easier option was to revisit the location where this material had been previously sourced. 

The overlying 0.6m depth of fill covered the whole area, sealing the second cut (15677) but lay within the boundaries of the first cut. It consisted of a midden and rubble rich deposit (16113/15656.15692), containing large quantities of burnt mud brick, charcoal and ash as well as quantities of animal bone, stone, obsidian, clay balls, pottery and figurines. It also contained an unfinished obsidian spearhead, 15656.X1.It was very similar to the underlying fill, the boundary only detected by the initial dumps of crushed scorched material in dark browns and oranges with more burnt but worn brick fragments followed by a barely detectible boundary to the overlying material of grey ash rich debris with midden component and larger and more fragments of weathered burnt brick fragments. 

Collectively these deposits represented redeposited material from middens with a burnt rubble component and a rapid deposition process, which was confirmed by an overview of the material assemblage. Although the deposits were broadly similar to what would be encountered in other midden contexts there were some notable variations with a comparatively narrower range of lithics and faunal taxa, although bird appeared to be overrepresented. The fauna suggested a post consumption signature but did not contain discreet deposits representing ‘feasting’ rather the range of taxa appeared quite diverse. The plant signature reflected a high density of midden type deposit with a dung component probably   derived from dung fuel. 

In comparison to other large quarry pits excavated at different locations at the site (Space  279 & Space 261 this report & Archive Report 2006),  this pit (15677) was rapidly infilled with secondary and tertiary material compared to slow midden accumulation of the others. It is also unusual to see bulk burnt debris in this context that is generally ‘managed’ by their containment within the burnt structure (B.52, B.1, B.79, B.80, B.77) (SF 30/05/11)"^^xsd:string ;

-may be related to rump of N/S wall 71 but this can only be speculation, as relationship has been lost (if there was any)
- wall stands to a height of 1 m at its highest, the top of the wall is not particularly clear due to erosion.
- courseing is fairly even along the base, but becomes more irregular on the upper courses. This of course may not be the face of the wall (which may be more uniform), explaining the unevenness of the courses.

Possible revetment wall - may be connected to wall 71, which would have to have stepped down  to join with it at the western end of wall 63. (this has to remain specualtive however)

  c:description "Oven in building 75, defined in 2007, excavated in 2008. Below is the description from the archive report, 2008.

The final use of the oven F.2637, was marked by an ashy build up, (15785), which was sealed by brick collapse and another ashy lens, (15783) and (15781). This sealed the upper floor, (16264) similar in composition to the lower floor sequence, but more patchy and founded on a dense foundation deposit, (16268), which supported a packed cluster of stone and highly fired clay fragments (resembling fragments of modern redbrick) (16275). This latest oven floor was approximately 10mm thick. Two more formal oven surfaces were identified with the later build/use of the oven, suggesting that the structure remained in use and maintained for almost as long as its earlier phase. The earliest of these, (16284), was very well preserved by scorching or baking, approximately 30mm thick. At its southern end it showed signs of
another residual surface, which may have been scoured out in a repair event. This surface was founded upon a thick band of make up material, (16292), which in turn sealed some residual ashy material, (16504). The make-up and surface was porous, showing signs of organic material which may have been used as a temper. The surfaces lay within the rebuilt superstructure which overlay an early oven sequence. The rebuilding event involved the construction of an internal course of roughly formed sandy-silt mudbrick and bonding material (16587). Indeed there was so much bonding material, it seems that much of the superstructure was almost moulded. The entrance of the oven superstructure remained at the northern end, the earlier superstructure was not obviously modified in itself (at least at foundation level) and the floor sequence continued as before, suggesting that this was more of a repair or strengthening event rather than a rebuild."^^xsd:string ;

Probably the remnant of Mellaart's excavations of a wall stretching to the East. The 2 remaining courses were rapidly eroding. It was later and abutted wall F88 to the West and was abutted by wall F69 tot he North. To the south and beneath, it was encased in an ashy, mixed deposit (2854) which also runs back tot he West and may have been cut into to construct the wall. It has no clear stratigraphic relationship to any of the adjacent walls and as so little of it was left it is difficult to tie into the sequence, but because of the slump of F69 tot he North it seems to have been built later against this."^^xsd:string ;

Updated 3/8/2013: We have removed the top course of bricks belonging to wall f. 3952, because the fill (u. 30844) from sp. 520 was evidently undercutting them. It is apparent that something has badly damaged the bricks in the center of this wall, but it is possible that this is from later animal burrowing and not from adding these bricks (u. 30856) after filling the space. Wall f. 3952 is the southernmost of 4 adjacent walls in the center of trench 3. Excavating room fill u. 30844 has revealed that wall f. 3952 is actually built partly on top of an earlier pit which explains in part why the middle of it is so slumping and wrecked. The floors associated with this wall, in both spaces 520 & 515, have not been preserved and in fact, in space 520, we have reached the bottom courses of this wall. Once the west side of this wall is in phase, it can be removed in 2014."^^xsd:string ;

Composed of brick (2867) and mortar (2868)

Discussion:
Short section of wall running from East to west to the north of space 105. 
There is no evidence of the wall continuing to the east, but it could have been partially removed by Mellaart. Only 2 courses of brick remained at the eastern end, where the wall slumped to the south. Elsewhere, a single layer of mortar overlying a single layer of brick (2867) was left. This mortar separated F70 from wall F88 tot he north and bridged walls F56 and F70 suggesting that the final courses of these walls were joined and that F70 was constructed after F56. A one time they may have formed part of the walls of the same space (105). A similar  layer of material also lies between F56 and F61 to the west. This could have been added at the same time as (2868) to infill the space between these walls, but alternatively might have been the result of a separate episode top support the construction of wall F61. AS the stratigraphical relationship between these walls  is not yet clear this layer was removed as a separate unit (2883) beneath the upper course of brick at the Eastern end of F70, a very mixed ashy layer (2873) lay to the north of the lower course of brick and appears to run underneath F70.

Discussion:
Wall 71 consisted of three courses of sandy yellowish brown bricks (3110) and mortar (3111), which were highly degraded. It seems to be the end of a wall which once ran from N to S, but no associated walls were left standing by the time that it was excavated. It was overlain by very mixed, ashy deposits, and similar materials also filled the gap between it and F69 to the North, suggesting that it never completely abutted this wall. Further mixed foundation deposits were placed above F71 before another wall was built above it  running from E to W [ F70] so it didn't provide any direct foundation for the walls above although it might have provided a handy lump of solid material to hold the subsequent wall in place (in retrospect)"^^xsd:string ;

Wall 74 lies at the northern end of space 159. It is made of the same material as walls 400 and 401, a light/mid brown sandy clayey siltbrick and light grey clayey mortar. The wall runs east-west and is relatively flat. It bonds on its western edge to wall 400 and on its eastern edge it forms a small southward buttress forming a jamb to a crawlhole 589 which is then numbered as wall 401. It looks as if walls 74, 400 and 401 were constructed at the same timeand are actually the same wall. The very northern extent of wall 400 where it joins with wall 74 was removed at the same time as wall 74 and treated as wall 74. This northern section is what remains of wall 400 nortyh of the part removed by Mellaart. On closer inspection it looks as though wall 74 is actually bonded with wall 400 and there is a thin skim  of wall 74 continuing east as the north wall of space 180

April 2000
Wall 74 is part of the north wall of building 24, level VII, to the east in space 180 the continuation of this wall has either collapsed post '60's or was dug in the '60's. The small southward extension represents a 'buttress' forming a doorjamb where Mellaart records a crawlhole. There was no obvious evidence of this as the area was used as a barrow run in the 60's, but the crawlhole was retrospectively numbered as 589. The southbound continuation of the wall is represented as wall 401.

Wall 88 was excavated further in 1998 to improve it's stability. this involved removing the upper two courses of bricks from the northern end, and upper four courses from the southern end where it was extremely precarious. The brick and mortar material seemed fairly homogeneous throughout this although there were large lumps of plaster and clay in places in the he mortar. The brick an mortar (2866) and (2871) were excavated separately for floatation sampling and then removed as a single composite unit (2889) until a stable level was reached. To be continued in 1999?
Where the wall turned to the west is soon petered out. It doesn't appear to descend further than the upper four courses of the wall F88 and was unsubstantial and very weathered. It could be that it was carved into when wall F75 was built to the West."^^xsd:string ;

This wall going from north-south line, at the east side of space 109. The wall consists of brick and mortar. Bricks are without block, straight lined. So we can think these bricks made in here.
Between bricks line we can see mortar. Bricks are olive-grey colour, mortars are light yellowish brown. We can see at lest 5 bricks lines 6 mortar  lines. This wall (94) Is later than wall (  ) to the east and later than wall (  ) directly below. But slightly off alignment. This wall same direction with earlier walls. At the lowest side bricks lines are different colour. From top brick : lowest two bricks light colour. But at the third line of bricks we can see mortar in the middle of  brick (between brick mortar ~5cm). The wall go down to the south. we found a bone between 3rd mortar and 3rd brick, at the mortar's inside it was found with plaster pieces.

Discussion: 
The north edge of wall cut by limit of excavation, with different due to erosion.
We said that before the brick line go on straight lined. But at the excavation we found two .. .. mortar between brick line (4th line from top).

  c:description "This is a huge post-Neolithic and pre-Hellenistic (could be Bronze Age) oven, which truncated the S wall of B. 110 (F.3995). It was situated outside two Neolithic buildings B.110 and B.121. This is the latest oven in a sequence of three ovens found in that space (Sp.519). Their concentration may indicate that the area west of those buildings was used as some kind of activity area somewhere after the Neolithic. 

Only E part of the oven was excavated as the remaining part is beyond the western edge of excavated area. Despite this, it is clear that the oven had a considerable size and was very high. 
It consists of a few infill layers mixed  with rubble. The brick walls were plastered from inside. The wall was of uneven width being much narrower at the bottom than on top. The character of constructional material and shape of the wall imply that the oven was domed.  Its function is unclear but it may have been used for metal smelting. 

The oven was arguably used in two consecutive phases. This is indicated by presence of plastered occupational level (‘floor’) half through the oven fill. Underneath this level, a large number of constructional elements, some of them really big, were discovered. At the bottom, a thick slag deposit was found. The inner face of the oven wall was slightly greenish, burnt and rough at this level. The very bottom fill layer was composed of a thick ashy deposit, placed itself on the wall, which the oven itself truncated.

Stratigraphic analysis of Space 519 implies that the oven was the latest in a sequence of three ovens in this space. It truncated the wall of the earliest oven (F.7190). Despite the lack of direct stratigraphic relations with the third oven (F.7181), as the later clearly postdates oven F. 7190, the relations between them is naturaly established."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "This feature was found during the 2012 season, but will not be excavated in 2012. It is overlayered by the sp 17/18 infill, U20481. The youngest layers of this feature were badly crumbled because people have run their wheel barrows there during the entire excavation. The crushed material has been removed, but remains of these layers are still visible in the eastern trench wall.

Currently we can see three or four layers of black, smooth, hard burnt clay surfaces, separated by gray silt makeup layers which are not affected by fire to the same extent. On top are some orange clay crumbles, possibly a rest of the oven roof. There are also remains of the upper part of the oven forming a broken, 0.02 m high north edge on top of clay surface U19598. Two of the upper, burnt clay surfaces have thick ash layers on top. The entire construction is very similar to the oven in the southern wall of building 77, F3621.

Added 2013:
Ecavated in 2013.

There are a few problematic stratigraphy points in this Feature.
At first, the sloping layers from S side to N side. It's possible that they moved the rest of the ash from the central part to to the sides. Also, the central part is smashed because of high temperature.
Next. Lowest layers were more thiner than upper. It's possible that they used lthe owest burnt layers for a relatively short time period. 
Next. The wall in the southern part of the Feature. It was built probably to close the area of using. Maybe they decided to use the oven to different aims or they didn't need such a big using area. 
Next. Plaster can indicate that they wanted to change oven area to something else, but they changed their plans. 

This Feature is different than F3621 in B77. Here is not plaster layers and layers are more irregular.

EA: This feature consists of units 2325 and 2325 of space 109 south wall half side brick line 6-8 cm x 25 cm x at least 90 cm. Between the bricks we can see mortar (unit 2326). The bricks of this wall are stronger than earth wall.

SF: 23.9:
this wall was half sectioned, the east half excavated early on in the season & the west towards the end. The wall construction incorporated a cavity, to house fire installation 82, the cavity was rectangular in shape ca. 1.4 m E-W and the depth of the wall 0.4 m. Bricks were laid with butt ends forming the sides of the cavity & a brick over the top to roof over. This cavity was subsequently moulded to form a curved FI. The brick ends to the east  had slumped slightly towards the cavity.
This E-W aligned wall forms the southern wall to space 109, bended with a northward bound wall to the east. It abuts wall 52 to the south & site over on earlier wall not numbered 1997. To the west it continues beyond the limit of excavation area.

The SE corner abutted wall 267 to the east which had a plastered face facing into space 109, it was therefore assumed that walls 94 + 98 were a secondary phase to space 109. However the wall 52 north face was not plastered & there was no evidence of activity associated with the earlier phase. It therefore appears that wall 267 was an early wall for which any association was removed (or has not yet been defined) & was the west wall for space 112, space 109 had its own set of walls represented by 94 and 98 but was later than wall 52, this because walls 52 and 267 are abutted by 94 & 98 or wall 52 forms the southern wall of space 112. Confused? (this sequence may change & should be more clear when wall 52 and 267 are completely excavated this year.)

  c:description "Small piece of north-south wall in space 150/151 which along with wall F97 separates the two spaces.

1998: This stub of wall was found to have been constructed over floor deposits and therefore recognised as a later  phase structure and interpreted as a narrowing to doorway 250.
Post-use of building 4 much of the flooring in space 150, through the doorway to space 151 was scoured out (some floors in space 150 removed by large pit 91). Consequently much of the floor level associated with wall 99 was destroyed particularly those to the west of wall 99. The stub of wall was initially believed to have been keyed into the southern wall 263 by use of a cut as it was constructed within a overhang in wall 263. However the overhang was then found to have been original, this overhang is actually a feature along the length of wall 263 in space 151 _only_. ( it is practically flush in space 150) and the face of wall 263 was also plastered continuous with plaster face of wall 263 in _space 151_.
Wall 99 was constructed in layers of brick aggregates - some mere  large-ish brick frags, some layers were a total mix of clayey material but very compact - enough to be a support of some sort. No explanation for why bricks weren't used. However having said that, brick may not have been suitable to 'key' this together with wall 263, whereas a more malleable deposit of multiple composition may have. At the base (3125, 3174, 3180 and 3188) were patchy deposits which may also have been make-up/packing  deposits which were very scrappy in nature and overlay earlier floor.
Along the southern edge of space 150 were remnants of floor, two floor surfaces represented by 3146/3145/3144 which overlay 31264/3152/3155/3151. These were only seen to be associated with wall 99 after its excavation and clearly seen as they stopped on a straight edge along the eastern edge of wall 99.

It is unclear as to why this doorway was narrowed in such a fashion. It may have had a double function, as a support buttress to wall 263 because of the relatively steep overhang. Question is why is the southern wall of space 150 vertical and the same wall in space 151 has an overhang. It may be that wall 263 in space 150 has also undergone some form of re-modelling?
On the other  hand wall 99 may well simply represent a door narrowing!
Space 150 was eventually closed off by blocking doorway 250 and therefore wall 99 was abutted by 250 (2314).
the reason or necessity for blocking doorway 250 is uncertain, originally believed to have been post-use of building 4, however it may have been blocked at the time when oven 260(?) was cut through from space 151 (Excavated and recorded SF, TC Aug 1998)"^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "This burial was first recognized by its in situ skeletal elements, ex situ elements of which where found in two other contexts (features 1705 and 1709). The extant part of the skeleton (unit 10814) is located roughly east-west, with its head located in the west. The body is on its back, and the leggs may have been drawn up over the chest and to the left.
Burial f. 1711 was heavily disturbed when later burial feature 1709 was put in place directly above. In the process of digging the cut for 1709 part of the skeletal elements of 1711 were lifted and put on the sides of the cut (u. 10830) of burial 1709 (or perhaps simply pushed a side).
Due to these circumstances no clear burial cut could be defined for f. 1711, and cut 10836 was defined on an arbitrary basis. Neither was the fill matrix (unit 10837) distinct from that of 10812 to the north. However, a clear break was found on the bottom, where a brown horizon with phytolithes extends over skeleton 10840 below.

It is of interest to note that it seems at present that skeleton 10840, 10814, and 10813 were all located in the same area, directly above one another, and seem to have had similar body positions.

A final matter of interest is that post-excavation work in the human remains lab showed that the isolated skull 10834 found in fill 10807 of post retrieval pit 1705 could be matched to the jaw of 10814, and equally some loose teeth from burial fill 10837 could be matched to the skull. Two scenarios:

First, at the time at which burial 1709 (above 1711) was cut some skeletal elements of 10814 were placed along the edge of 1709. It is possible that the skull was placed on the eastern edge of the cut 10830 of burial 1709, and was then encountered when post retrieval pit 1705 was cut, lifted, and then placed in this pit. This scenario seems unlikely to me given the distict matrix of the fill of 1705 (unit 10807) compared to that in the fill of 1709 (unit 10831). Second the skeletal elements of 10814 placed along the edge of 1709 seem to suggest that the two cut features touched, but that 1705 did not really disturb 1709.

Second, it is possible that at the time at which 1709 was cut (cut unit 10830) some elements of 10814 were put along the edge of this feature, but the skull was lifted and than placed in 1705. This scenario would imply that burial 1709 was put at approximately the same time that post retrieval pit 1705 was cut (it is ofcourse possible that skull 10834 was out in the 'open' for some time."^^xsd:string ;

Only a small section was exposed to clarify its relationship with building 1. As layer, 2593 is under wall F217 but had clearly built up against wall F5. Thus wall F217 is later than wall F5.
            Wall F5 is presumably the southern wall of a building composed of spaces 33/32/30(?) unless it is an additional wall in between.

Discussion:
Wall only very slightly sectioned. Southern wall of building to north of building 1. Building is clearly later than building 1. Walls suggest that as little as 0.3m may survive.

  c:description "28/07/04  Large, roughly rectangular plaster and mudbrick feature originally 30 cm high.  It was originally thought to be a possible stepping platform or a large bin.  At the bottom of the feature, the profile shows that the entire feature is at a later level than the other features around it.  As well, the feature itself contains multiple phases, each a separate unit.  The northern most edge is a plastered rim that reaches to the bottom of the feature.  The eastern edge of this rim has been cut down until it is  only 5 cm high at the end.

02/08/04  This feature upon excavated has been revealed to be a bin, with earlier and later phases under and around the bin.  The stratigraphy of this feature is rather complicated.  The feature extends on the western edge from the edge of feature 1659, and its eastern edge is the western edge of unit 7943.  The southern edge is the southern wall of space 100 (F. 1658), and the northern edge is the bin wall, unit 7963.  The feature contains the entirety of a bin, as well as two possible other bins as well as a possible unplastered surface or platform.

The earliest phase is represented by unit 7968,  which isn only a profile under the units 7966 and 7965.  This was a series of unplastered surfaces or possibly platforms that was joined by F.1666, which also are on top of this series of surfaces.  The elevation of surface 7960 is lower than the elevation of 7968, and so  cuts into the surfaces, but on the souther wall of space 100 behind unit 7960, there is scaring in the plaster showing that the surfaces went into the wall in some way. Because other features are on top of this surface, it is not excavated and it cannot be well understood.  

The second phase is represented by unit 7966, which is a single plaster block.  This block may have been an earlier bin, but the rest of the bin is now missing or not yet excavated.  This has been interpreted as the second phase as it is above the phase apparent in 7968, but the north and south sides of this unit have been cut y units 7965 and 7964.  It is clear that it is not a part of the later bin, as the ends of the unit are cut by the bin and the construction of the plaster block is quite different than that of the other, later bin to be discussed below.  The western wall of the later bin may have rested on this unit as well.

The third phase is the main bin of feature 1652.  This consists of units 7952, 7955 and 7961 as the fill of the bin, and features 7959, 7960, 7963 and 7964 as the remaining floors and walls of the bin.  Units 7963 and 7964 are the walls of the  unit, but were cut from on another, perhaps by the next phase, discussed below.  The eastern end of 7963 has been truncated down to the level of the surface 7959.  It is possible that once, the wall went all around the entire bin at the same elevation and has since been truncated.  However, there is no scar in the southern wall of space 100 where 7963 would have hit the southern wall to indicate its absence, so it is also possible that the eastern end of the bin was in fact a small plastered platform or surface abuting the bin.  Surface 7959 is a nicely plastered surface, while the surface of 7960 has a much thinner plastered surface and is 2-3 cm below that of 7959.  In excavation, these two surfaces were divided by a thin plaster line, which may have been the eastern wall of the bin, or maybe a dividing wall of the bin.  The line was removed during excavation to discover the relationship between the two surfaces better.  There was again no scaring in the souther wall of space 100 to indicate its absence, so the purpose of the line is still somewhat unclear.  

The fourth and final visible phase in feature 1652 is represented by unit 7965.  This unit is a dividing wall, possibly the wall of the bin in F.1666.  This unit cuts the northern end of unit 7966, as well as the eastern end of 7963. 

JLD 14/08/06
This feature appears to be at least two bins or basins which were repeatedly destroyed / collapsed and remodelled throughout their use life. The earliest construction is a small narrow feature (13655. 13656) along the E. edge of platform F1666 (from which a horn core was recovered in 2004). This was leter added to creating a large double bin.
Eventually the height was built up to apporimately 38cm and a final layer of plaster was applied creating a concave bottomed basin.This plaster layer was alluded to in the 2004 archive and was also visible as a faint sloping scar on the plastered south wall (F.1658).
At some point the bin walls were demolised or collapsed and a pit [13648] was dug through the walls to either retrieve a much earlier cache or to access a pit cut into platform F1666 (visible in plan within truncated area). The later phases of construction then occurred as numerous dumps, irregular layers of different coloured silty clays and plaster.
The function of the layers (13622, 13623, 13620) infilling the gap between the W wall and the internal wall and the wooden post (13628) is uncertain but slight traces of plaster may hint that this was a third basin-like structure.
These basins were all constructed fairly late in the lifetime of the house."^^xsd:string ;

Discussion:
One of three infant burials interred in upper make-up/foundation infill for building 1 together and all apparently respecting the wall F 3. This wall was constructed contemporaneously with the foundation layer and the burials seem to have been placed in the deposit soon after its deposition and prior to the sub-floor packing (1434). All three showed variously unclear \"cuts\" and were only recognised when bone was exposed. Whether or not they were in cuts (all probably were in some kind of \"scoop\") or interred during the infilling is perhaps insignificant as the lapse of time between deposition of the layer and the burials was probably minimal. The position of these three burials maybe significant as all are placed by the threshold of the access between spaces 70 and 71, even though at the time of internment the house was actually not completed."^^xsd:string ;

This oven is built in the south part of space 229. It appears that there was originally some sort of doorway in the south wall of the building in the vicinity of the hearths. This may have been altered in such a way that all that remains is a plastered area on the end of the south wall, and a layer of packing material that was used to block up the hole in the wall once the oven was built.
After the construction of space 229 the middin in space 241 was allowed to build up against the southern wall for some time and presumably that was contemporary with the presence of the doorway. The oven lays over a layer of middin of yet indeterminate thickness and also has post construction midden built up around and over it. Therefore the oven was an extension to the building and was later taken out of use by having its top half removed. The structure that is left has some height of wall still standing  but the floor surface is exposed. There appear to be at least 2 floor surfaces to the oven.
It is also possible that there were earlier phases to the oven construction than can currently be seen  there are indications from inside the space that burning layers continue below those currently exposed."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "A fire installation located at the south of space 163.  Appears to be in Mellaarts final plans of area.  Truncated possible platform 4281 to west.  An earlier fire or preparation was involving the cut, and three burnt or heat deposits 4178, 4177, 4176 and 4175 (phase A).  Above this superstructure 4331 was built (B).  Then various phases of fire prep and fire bases (C) and (D), all with a slope from N to S.  A final phase, probably truncated was encountered under the baulk (E).  

This was a very substantial oven, and reused many times.  It is not known why the oven bases were sloping, maybe it was intentional. Or maybe some subsidence which caused them to continually level, and re-make the superstructure.

Cuts into wall F.485 (south wall).

(sf dec 00)
This oven was located directly below 1960's backfill supporting fact that it had been previously exposed. This is by far the largest oven excavated so far, located on the south wall of the larger room, cut into the south wall slightly.

Slightly pear shaped, widest against the wall, it measured max. 1.5m N - S x 1.18m E - W x 0.63m depth as survived . 

Probably originally domed although no superstructure survived, and we should consider that it was probably over this oven that the ladder was placed in this final phase of the building. At earlier phases the ovens were located in the NE corner of the building, 437 replaced by 433, both elaborate but not as large as 416. This therefore reflects quite a change in the layout of the building through its life use and spatial use and entrance from roof. 

The stratigraphical eveidence for this being a late oven lies in the fact that it seals a small fire installation  ([4392]), and other associated burnt deposits and posts [4390] and [4334], it also cut platform 428 to the west which appears to be an original construction. The oven also apperas to be assocaited with a clay ball pit 440, which may have been in use pre- oven, possibly associated with hearth activity ([4392]), it also seals a small cut [4399] with an unusual array of finds, a foundation deposit?????

F529 was the remains of a truncated hearth against the southern wall of building 23 / space 170.

To the west of this was the truncated remains of what could have been the superstructure of this oven [4787]. This interpretation is supported by the way that the superstructure curves around the hearth and it is possible (with a bit of imagination!) to trace a scar where it once arched towards the hearth base, in the plaster on the wall to the south. However, since the hearth base and cut are seperated from the superstructure by the 'floor packing' layer [4773] this seems to be a very unusaul structure for an oven. We would either re-interpret [4773] as oven foundation material, or re-interpret [4787] as some sort of E-W partition / divide."^^xsd:string ;

This feature represents a mudbrick wall first thought to be the western limit of Building 42. Initially seen in 2002 during excavations for the shelter footings, and was given F825, assumed to be a continuation of a wall found further to the south. However, the wall was renumbered due to evidence to suggest that this is actually an internal wall built at a later date across floor surface (10411). Only c.0.1m remains due to heavy truncation.
Given feature number F1504, but also given unit number (10410) to account for finds recovered from mudbrick make up.
Wall consisted of a single course and bricks were of a light reddish brown colour, suggesting either heat treatment or burning at some stage in their lives. Due to the high levels of truncation created by Mellaart in the 1960s, it is impossible to say what or why this wall was here, and what it was delineating. Was it a later inclusion to separate particular activities? Further to the south, there is a suggestion that the wall acts as some form of boundary (W) for hearth F1507, and ultimately a 'dirty' space. This however is not conclusive but may act as a suggestion as to the walls purpose."^^xsd:string ;

From Archive Report 2006:

Two major phases of oven sequence were revealed during the excavation with later oven F.2060 replacing the earlier F.2076. Oven F.2060 was filled with demolition/dump (11695), this was removed to reveal a dark ashy deposit (11696) that contained a grindstone cluster (11696).

  c:description "F1501 describes the NE platform in building 42 and consists of only 3 phases of make up and plastering. F1519 wall originally helped define area of F1501 (and F1502). Make up layers of silt/ sandy sily with few inclusions of varying thickness underlie plaster surfaces some showing signs of wear and some contemporary with those on F1502.
Burials F1511, F1513 +F1514 are cut into make up layers between plaster surfaces, in separate phases. Most interestingly burials F1516 + F1517 (with plastered skull (11330)) underlie F1501 but are confined by its later extent!
 The latest activity connected with this platform is F1508, niche, which possibly held a bucrania.

DISCUSSION
Platform F1501 constructed as an intrgral part of internal features of B42, with platform F1502 and bench F1503 to S.
 The platform cnsists of 3 distinct phases of make up and plastering; platform initially layed out and constructed/ plastered as a whole with F1502, then 2 graves F1513 +F1514 cut into make up layer above that, then plastered over.- End of 2nd phase of plastering and mirrors what is happening on F1502. Again in 3rd phase make up is cut by grave F1511 before being plastered over by (10407), final/ uppermost plastered surface. The latest event being the construction of bucrania, suggested by niche F1508, again mirroring F1502.
The pre platform activity of burials F1516+ 7 are interesting as they suggest a knowledge of where platform F1501 was going to be and so a sense of planning and vision of how this building was to be built and ordered through its lifetime. It also suggests NE platform F1501 was a focal point, plastered skull (11330), only 2nd in Turkey, recovered from F1517.
 Burials F1516+7 + deposition of plastered skull (11330) may suggest some sort of foundation deposit for B42 and that the area under F1501 was appropriate; was this spot chosen because NE platform normally has lots of burial activity and is seen as a focal point or does the burial and  plastered skull then make the Ne platform special because of it?
 The sequence of F1501 is also interesting as burials are always made through the make up deposits and prior to plastering events- is this because the finnish and the appearance of the platform is paramount? This has not been noted in other houses on the east mound where burials are considered to be in general cut through the plaster surfaces.
If the finish of the platforms was important was  this some sort of show house, possibly the knowledge of these burials rather than their physical presence was important, or some sort of closing event / ceremony?
The latest raising of F1501 happens after F1501+2 were level, the time between these events is unknown- days, or weeks/ months?- but the final appearance of both F1501+2 was coherent in that both had possible bucrania as suggested by F1508 on F1501 and F1509 on F1502.
Elaboration and ?overtly 'ritual' additions to platform suggest central part it played in house and activities that occured within it.
F1501 + F1502 should be considered more of a complete entity rather than separate platforms + activities. Areas of focus, areas of similar meanings + occasionally different/ specific meanings.

  c:description "F1502 describes the central eastern  platform between NE platform F1501 and bench F1503. This platform 1502 consists of 4 separate phases of make up and  plastering, some contemporary with phases on F1501. Two graves F1512+ F1515 are cut into different phases and a niche F1509 and basin F1505 are cut into the latest phase. The different phases of this platform but against bench F1503 with plaster lipping up, suggesting continued  and pos contemporary refurbishment.
The make up layers consist mainly of silts or sandy silts with few inclusions, built up in thin or thicker layers over which the plaster was laid. The plaster layers appear similar in that a rougher plaster was overlayen with a finer thinner finishing surface. All plaster surfaces showed signs of wear and tear, mainly on western part.

DISCUSSION
Platform F1502 constructed as an integral part of platform F1501 and bench F1503 on E side of B42. It was a planned part of the internal features from the start.
In the first 2 phases F1502 and F1501 are constructed moreor less as a complete entity- same make up and plaster layers cover them both and graves F1515 in F1502 and F1513/F1514 in F1501 cut through make up layers before plastering over both platforms.
 It is in the 3rd phase that different activity becomes apparent on F1502; It becomes apparent that the platform is slumping and attempts to counter that are taken. Grave F1512 is also cut in this 3rd phase, but in contrast to the previous ones on F1501+2 it is cut through the plaster surface (10457). Several make up layers are then added to counter slumping in SE part of F1502 and platform is raised up to be level with F1501.
The only activity after this on F1502 is the cutting of F1505 basin and construction of bucrania represented by niche F1509. It is unclear whether F1501 is raised before this and its own bucrania added or if it was  a later embelishment, they do appear though to have stood contemporaneously for the end of their lifespan even if constructed at slightly different dates.
At end of B42 lifespan, basin filled in and bucrania removed.
So F1502 appears to have been an area of special activity; each of the 4 phases of plastering show wear or thourough scouring before next phase...area of clenliness? Platform also appears to be used as a place of burial; F1515 under plaster- hidden and F1512 through plaster, pos referencing F1515? This is where marble mother goddess figurine recovered (10475x2) pos a deliberate deposit or redeposited from midden below or F1515 (see sheets). Finally basin F1505 again pos referencing graves as in same location; and bucrania- area of ritual? Platforms as focal point in house? Platform not just a raised area, but area representing different activities/ meanings over and at different times, yet element of continuity and little change; only 4 phases!

Needs entering (SF 24.06.02)

Horseshoe shaped oven, its eastern part is presented to a height of 30cm and is constructed by 4 clearly distinct upright mudbricks of approx 10-9cm thickness.  İts western part is poorly preserved and distinct mudbricks can not be easily identified.  Thickness of W wall c.9cm.  The northern tip of the oven shows a mouth 47cm wide which is slightly offset to the west.  The mudbricks are made of yellowish clay  very well tempered with sand and they look very much similar to the mudbricks used in the building. The internal part of the oven shows three reconstructions of the floor.  The uppermost floor is based on thin spread  of white lime, which also partially covers the west wall.  This spread covered a half circular area which resided approx. 30cm from the mouth of the original oven.  İt is likely that the oevn in this final stage was used as a hearth.  İn this phase also the remains of the original hearth to the north of the lime speard was filled up with frgaments of mudbrick and clay.  The next floor is made of plaster and gravel and baked hard with a lot of cracks.  The earliest (third floor) shows signs of burning and is very soft and sandy (this is possibly the make up for the floor? (RR 6/7/09).  The west wall of the oven had been reinforced by a thick 11cm addition of sandy material similar to mubrick over the sde of which the lowest floor abbuts.

Structuarally amorphous, pair of sub-linear 'walls' (which may have been subcircular but this cannt be proven dueto later truncation in the north east corner by F. 1258?). The wall to the west had a slightly rounded profile, the easternmost was collapsed mudbrick and deflated.  They may have been indistinguishable from the surrounding/adjacent make-up material (14807), but for the presence of irregular lumps/fragments of orange brown sandy mudbrick.

The oven was filled with a thick laminated sequence of interleaving ashy deposits (mainly black, but also lighjt grey (white) containing charcoal and white flecks (phytoliths?).

Bricks: 0.67 L x 0.85 B x 0.32 T m
E/W wall. possibly forming a southern revetment to midden rubbish or possibly was a foundation for a building.
-may be related to rump of N/S wall 71 but this can only be speculation, as relationship has been lost (if there was any)
- wall stands to a height of 1 m at its highest, the top of the wall is not particularly clear due to erosion.
- courseing is fairly even along the base, but becomes more irregular on the upper courses. This of course may not be the face of the wall (which may be more uniform), explaining the unevenness of the courses.

1) It is part of a wall which has been largely truncated.

3) It was inserted because the gap between walls F52 and F75 was too large and was unstable.

The platform was covered by a relatively thick layer of wood ash and timber fragments, and a cluseter of animal bone and grind stone.

(*): in post-ex this relationship was reviewed and found to overlay wall 70. SF

Discussion:
This section of wall was not recorded in the original section drawing and appears to have been partially excavated (by Mellaart?). What was left of it was cracked and crumbling, IT seems to be the remains of a wall running to the west which is no longer present. It abuts wall 88 but it's relationship to this is hard to ascertain without any direct stratigraphic relationship. I would suggest that it was later. It's relationship to cuts (2862) and (2863) is also hard to decipher as both are above layer (2854) and abut one another.

SF: during post-ex this was considered as being the same as wall 61 as both these walls lay on the same alignment and can be stratigraphically correlated but there is no direct stratigraphic link, therefore this is an interpretation only."^^xsd:string ;

On the other hand, packing (unit #6244) was very thick (7-15 cm), realtively loose and with surfaces covered with salts, which may indicate some organic material being stuck to these blocks of rubble used to build the platform. 
With unit #6250 layers of plasterings on the western corner of the platform were removed, and it was apparent that the platform is later than the neighbouring F. 1003 (bin). The lower part of the platform towards south was curving, most probably because it was added later to the small platfrom that stretched along the north wall. Inside this older platform anima bone tools and obsidian tools and ochre were found and it can be assumed that they were placed there deliberately.

The feature comprises many superimposed floors with little or no packing in between. Therefore we excavated them as group, arbitrarily 5 floors at a time, i. e. 2-3 cm a layer.
A number of shallow pits were dug into these floors at various levels. Most were clearly filled with burned material (features 615, 616, 619, 620), others filed with dark soil with less burned material (features 618, 621, 641).
Excavation of floors 1-5 was completed in 1999, except for the bulks that were photoed and drawn in 2000 and excavated. Floors 5-10 were excavated in the north part in 1999 and completed in 2000.

The burial was sealed with a thin layer of plaster which was of a different colour compared to the surrounding plaster of the platform (greyish, while the rest of the surface is yellowish).
The burial pit is bell-shaped. The fill consisted of grey ashy deposits and brown bricky clay mixed with pieces of plaster from the floor, charcoal, animal and human bones that don't belong to the individual in question (phalanges, carpal). The soil is relatively soft, but packed. Lumps of phytoliths were collected for analysis. 
The skeleton is poorly preserved. It is an individual of the age of three. The skeleton was put in a basket, which is also in bad state of preservation. The basket is located at the ceiling of the burial pit. In the collapse of the platform floor the basket remains stayed attached to the \"ceiling\" and in one piece.

NOTES IN 2000:
Human bones were concentrated in eastern portion of the pit. The head was crushed and facing down. Orientation is SE-NW. 
Patellae may be from same individual (right + left); other bones may represent a single adult individual. Animal bones and obsidian were found in eastern portion. A line of whitish material was noted in the eastern area of the pit, below the burial. It is probably a layer of thin plaster, rather than phytoliths or salts.

  c:description "Description:
A depression against wall F1564 at the north end of F2129- the main floor area of Sp 227 in Bldg 58.
Possibly an original cut- subsequently 'filled'/ covered by floor surfaces of 2129 at least down to plaster floor 13219. (Since no deeper than this layer was excavated in 2006 the presence of an original cut is a hypothesis and the feature cannot be considered completed).

Discussion:
At some point after layer 13219 (or possibly a later floor layer) was laid, the north wall of Bldg 58 appears to have slumped. It is possible that an original cut of a feature (ie F2251- recess/ niche maybe?) undermined the wall. A cut into wall F1564 seems visible but is unclear. This slumping seems to have pushed a large section of wall plaster -13266- into the depression. At this point a lump  of plaster-13252- seems to have been pushed up against this wall plaster- perhaps to try to keep it in place. Another slumped section of damaged wall plaster- 13222- was packed into the depression immediately in front of 13266. Following this it seems the depression was filled- by 13217 and 13218- either as a deliberate attempt to level the depression up to the new floor surface, or as a result of further slumping from wall F1564. It is possible that later floor layers than 13219 covered this 'fill' but the truncation of the floor surfaces in the north of Sp 227 and the artificial 'overhang' created by the slumping of F1564 made this difficult to determine. It is recommended that wall F1564 be dropped to properly see the extent of F2251 as well as the dropping of floor layers below 13239. This could easily change the interpretation."^^xsd:string ;

It looks as if this might be a later surface than the platform (F.1651) because the surface is over the plaster.  The full extent of this cannot determined at this stage.  On the east side there appears to be a cut in the surface, which is composed of a different soil matrix than the surrounding surface.  Bones are present in this deposit but if they are human or animal has not yet been determined.  This cut may also be connected with the cut in the east wall (U.7945) but this relationship is also unconfirmed.

F2917 reinforces division between North and South originally defined by plaster and core (16027)(16030) linking F3000+ F3001.

It is made up of mudbrick material (some of which showed signs of burning - possibly reused mudbrick?) and mortar (see continuation sheet for unit 8069 for sketch of mudbricks and mortarlines).  Along its eastern edge a basin or storage bin seems to have been incorporated into its design or possibly cut into it at a later date although there was no boundary or divide - this feature forms one whole.  Along its southern edge was a basin - feature 1300 - the plaster surface of this feature partially covered the southern part of 1302.  The northern edge has been cut by a later pit (feature 100)

See unit sheet 8069 (plus its continuation sheet) for further description.

In excavating this feature, we quickly recognized that following its rectangular shape in plan would cause us to surpass the terracing cut [30229] which it was built into. The cut is quite jagged and irregular, and it seems as if this wall's bricks were packed into the cut, as well as the oven below, rather opportunistically. This wall, however, unlike f.7150, was built before the makeup layer u.30273 of wall f.7153, suggesting it is a true exterior wall, unlike f.7150.

An E-W aligned kerb was delineated extending from the east wall but not traced up to the wall that was obscured by the LOE. This kerb was 0.4m wide and stood two bricks high (as excavated), made of reused bricks both on edge and laid along the southern side. This appears to be the original construction forming a low partition wall or kerb with very faint traces of plaster on the north face. Sometime later in its use it appears that the kerb was widened with a packing material along the northern side. In this form both sides, including its western butt end lying just 0.2m in from the western L.O.E of the trench, were heavily plastered. To the south of the wall was a thick accumulation of finely laminated floors, all heavily fire blackened. A N-S aligned kerb was also defined halfway along the west LOE. Within the demarcated area to the north of these kerbs or walls was a semicircular depression of laminated burnt floors, whilst to the south were more laminated floors around a circular hearth in the SW corner. This charred horizon was excavated as an arbitrary unit (16303) to define the sequence and to reach formation level.

  c:description "This is an interesting feature, constituting the illusionary middle of Sp 17 and Sp 18. It is an illusion because the building continues a good way into to the N and E trench walls, but this is the center piece of the trench so to say. Anyway, it consists of 3 units at the moment, of which one is fully removed, u.20907. It should be added also that this plaster collapse probably is mixed with other materials as well. Plaster in the wall had red paint on it but was removed ca 15 cm because it was collapsing from the exposure.

So why do I call this feature a center piece even if it is an illusion? There are just so many additions and activity (obviously ritually associated as well) connected to this feature; it is hard to ignore that it has been center of a lot of events. How this feature was formed and why will be answered perhaps when it is removed, perhaps it even was a bigger wall connected to the S wall as they (and I) initially thought in 2012, but we will see. It is clearly an isolated internal wall on this level, but it is not excavated fully 2013.

However at some point a lot of additions were made. The first one seems to be F.3698 (also not excavated yet). The basin F.3699 and bin F.7306 might have been added approximately contemporarily, but this is hard to say even if there is a physical connection. This wall was also cut by a burial, or rather baby dump, F.7138, and another two babies were buried in close proximity of this feature. One last remark is on the relation between the building infill u.20481 and the wall: an amount of nice obsidian was found in the bottom of the infill over 2u.0908, but actually they might derive from the wall as the remains of a deposition."^^xsd:string ;

          The fill of the feature consisted of a large number of clay balls and fragments ( 4291 ) within a silty clay matrix. Those towards the top of the fill were mostly fragmentary while those towards the base were mostly complete. This suggests some trampling with some damage to the upper deposit but the depth of the fill protecting the lower balls. The concentration of the clay balls suggests that the pit was used primarily for clay ball storage, and its location close to a large oven ( F416 ) suggests a relationship with the use of this feature. It has been suggested that clay balls may have been used as pot boilers and their location in a store close to a heat source appears quite conceivable.

(sf 2000) It's is possible that this feature was in constant use throughout the life span of the building as the cut neither clipped the platform nor the oven but the fills of the pit appear cut, or abutting?"^^xsd:string ;

The plan of the feature seemed very regular with light gray and mid (dark towards fire affected NE corner) gray periodically repeated patches. 
The feature was built on top of the floor of earlier platform (U30519) and the bench F7118 (forming a ridge on top of it) and the space between the walls and the wall of the space (F2106) was filled with infill (U20657) soon after that. The light gray layers seems to be forming the coating (the sides and the bottom) of the partition walls and the darker, more friable materials forms its core. The inner sides of the walls were concave with clay applied in an erratic way without paying attention to creating smooth surfaces, which left hand and finger prints suggesting the way it was applied.
The feature was later at some point reconstructed around its SE corner joining it with unknown plastered feature F7316 to form plastered surface on its E side.

The N part forming the ridge on top of the bench F7118 was excavated in 2013. Two units U30526 and U30527 were assigned to the coating and the core respectively. Both are without a doubt the same as the rest of the partition walls."^^xsd:string ;

At first I thought that the bin was demolished so that the crawl-hole could be put through # but then noticed the rear on both sides of the crawl-hole (see sketch) - + this had been replastered on both sides. On the west side the demolition material backfilling the bin is up against this replastering - so the backfill post-dates the use of the crawlhole - which implies that the bin comes after the crawlhole.

Discussion: 'Cut' 4509 / F.530 is a plaster - lined crawlhole through e-w wall F.482. 4509 was recorded as a cut, but the plaster lining is a continuation of the north and south face wall plaster, so 4509 is integral to F.482 - part of the original construction. Immediately to the north and west of 4509 is a partly revealed, (un-numbered and unexcavated), circular feature. This is possibly a bin, which supports the idea that the narrow e-w area - Sp. 179, north of F.482, is for storage.

Final feature on top of the long lasting platform in the NE corner of space 170.

The bins were quite shoddily bodged over the top of one upstanding arm of oven superstructure. Each separate unit was joined to the other with white plaster.

Pre-dating the arms was a fairly good white plaster surface (5053) which acted, presumably, as a base to the bins.This plaster lipped up under the bin arms, implying that it was built as one thing."^^xsd:string ;

Small pit cut into main floor of Sp 227. Cut into layer 13221. Contained an ashy deposit and a cluster of fragmentary clay objects

Discussion:

Feature 2250 was a small pit cut into the main floor of space 227 in building 58. The feature was 'sealed' by a slightly sunken deposit of plaster given unit number 13209 but possibly the same layer as 13207?
The feature contined a fill- 13211 which contained a cluster of fragmentary clay objects/ possible horn figurines = 13212
Beneath this fill there was a distinctive deposit of dark ashy material - 13213- certainly a burnt deposit. However, it is unclear whether this fill represented an in-situ fire (possibly unlikely as associated deposits appear not to have been affected by heat) or more likely redeposited ash.
A piece of obsidian found in association with the clay objects was also assigned an x find number- see sheet 13212"^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Notes from 2000:
This fire installation was first recognized as shallow, ellipsoid scoop filled with loose, brown deposit akin to fills of #6266 and #6268 of adjacent fire installation F. 630 in the northeast edge of platform F. 169. Once this was removed, level of clay \"lining\" this scoop was removed as #6270 with another dark patch in the center. At the time it was believed that dark patch was another hearth between F. 630 and F. 632, but it appears to be continuing dark soil, probably scorched soil beneath it. This patch was removed, together with level of floor around F. 632, but as a separate flotation sample (S7), since both zones were lying at the platform (extension packing).
Comparing this sequence with F. 630 it is apparent that the proper hearth floors are missing, yet these may have well been removed prior to opening of this feature, or deliberately destroyed in the past. On the basis of sloping floor #6295 associated with it, it is possible that hearth was placed opportunistically in the depression on platform. Also, absence of hearth floor like in F. 630 may mean less burning and shorter life span.
Notes in 2001:
While digging the base (scoop/depression) of this fire installation we discovered that it cut earlier fire installation F.752.
It's very possible that this cut doesn't belong to any fire installation, since there wasn't any deposit in it which would indicate burning, no ash, charcoal or scorched clay. The southern part of it was actually filled with soil belonging to the abutting hearth (F. 752) cut by this feature."^^xsd:string ;

The floors of the feature exists. There are 3-4 thin and fragile floors visible, but all of them damaged in the central part of the basin. The hardest is the top floor which is hardened and preserved all around the visible edge. At the intersection of this floor and wall there is a thin and continuous line of white.

  c:description "First recognized as a filll og the pit containing reddish brown and grey soil with salts and phytoliths; two bone tools and an animal tooth were found in it. The cut was long, elipsoid, with sharp top break, steeply sloping sides and a flat base. 
In 2002, when the plaster from the interior face of the east wall was removed and all the floors in the space 201 excavated, it become obvious that this feature comprises a blocked opening in the north half of the east wall og building 3. At the bottom there is a brick that looks like a threshold, placed directly on the midden on which the whole house was sitting. Bricks and mortar used to block the opening are of the same kind as in the rest of the east wall, which means that this event happened at some point in the history of the house. Mortar is brown in colour, made of lumpy clay and is extraordinary strong. The same type of mortar is put in the east wall (4th layer from the bottom of the wall upwards) at the spot where a major change in bricks and mortar begins.
In 2003 a posthole next to the 'opening' was discovered and excavated as unit #8633. It looks as if  a wooden post was taken out at the time when the opening was closed. The fill of the post contained bricky materila and the bottom of the hole was covered with fine layer of mudbricks above midden. After the fill of the post was removed, two step-like structures appeared. 

In order to enclear F. 633, in 2003 the top soil layer east from F. 762 was scraped and the deliniations of the wall(s) and the space(s) to the E from bldg. 3 were planned (units #8623, 8652). Now the wall (F. 1023) abutting wall F. 762 can be followed. It consists of narrower bricks, cca 0.28-0.30 m wide. It (or part of it) probably existed before bldg. 3 had been constructed. 
Within F. 633 several units were opened - #8631, 8633, 8659, 8665. Units #8631, 8650 and 8665 are parts of the packing that closed the opening. It consisted of bricky material and crumbly clay. The bricks were thin, 4-5.5 cm thick. About 4 rows of such bricks and thin layers of crumbly mortar between them could be encountered. It seems that the bricks were put in when they were still wet, so they were stuck together. Their surfaces are discerned only by thin layers of salts. 
When this packing was removed, we came to a layer of black midden-like material, which most probably wa sthe walking surface of the opening at the time when it was closed. Under this black surface there were 3 or 4 plastered floors with packing layers that were on top of a 'step', covered with white plaster, which was obviously part of the opening. 
There are two more units which are closely related to F. 633, #8652 and #8672. Unit # 8652 revealed the deliniations of the wall abutting the east wall of building 3 (F. 1023). Unit #8672 wa steh fill of a narrow space (N-S=1m, E-W=0.28m) between wall F. 762 and wall F. 1023. It could be regarded as some sort of extension of the fill/packing of the opening. 
Within unit #8689 the previously encountered floors were excavated. The excavated area is 1.03x0.60 m and thin layer of plaster (>1 mm thick) cf. central floor area on 5 mm layer of beige sandy packing were removed. All the floors were excavated as one unit. Towards east and north the floors cannot be followed. There are salty layers especially in the northh end, and also a thick plaster (5 cm) at the south end of the step. 
Under the \"floors\" of the treshold entrance of bldg 3, a layer of packing (5 cmm thick) was excavated with unit #8691. A sandstone slab (6 cm long) was found at the bottom of packing. There are thicker bricks in south part and in north part the bricks are more like hard yellow packing.

Three fragments appear to be from one basket that had collapsed. The base fragment measures 4.5 cm in diameter corresponds to the length of the large piece which looks to be the side of the basket. Otherwise, the basket appears to be in good condition. 
One human rib fragment was found attached to block of X2. Taken to conservation lab.

  c:description "I have started to excavate the floor with unit #6300. It seemed that the plastering was either removed during last year's excavation or it was missing originally. Anyway, this layer was very thin and I removed it to the very next plastering. Unit #6315 was thin as well. It didn't reveal the connection (which we assumed) with the platform. Until the next floor unit #6318 this connection became clear. This floor was contemporaneous with platform unit #6263. I took for the analysis (ICP, phosphates, phytoliths) the soil from the vertical side of the platform. It was very grey in colour. After removing unit #6329 clear edges of some sort of a cut appeared. This cut had unit #6337. Next to this cut (towards west) another cut appeared. This unit #6340 was probably in connection with the ladder and entrance. It was reddish and deep. Eastern part of unit #6329 was left unexcavated.
The bottom of the unit #6337 was the floor which is clearly in connection with the floor of the unit #6268, with its N-E part.

  c:location "North of space 94, within platform 3694"^^xsd:string ;
  c:dimensions "75cm x 57cm x 38cm"^^xsd:string ;
  c:description "The burial 7127 is distinctive and surprising for two reasons : 

First, it is a multiple burial where one adult (an old man? u.30514) was buried along with 4 juveniles of different ages (infants/children : u.30510, u.30511, u.30513, u.30524). The adult was flexed, lying on its back on the bottom of the cut (u.30502). Three infants/children were piled on its left side (u.30524, u.30513 & u.30511). Another one was crossing above its right side (u.30510). Two of the juveniles had their cranium in direct contact with the forehead of the adult (back of the cranium of u.30513 and forehead of u.30511). 
This burial is a single event. This 5 individual were buried together at the same moment. Indeed, no disturbance which could indicates several episodes of digging / deposing a new body was observed. The position of the differents bodies, very intricate and often in direct contact, is impossible to realize in several burial without disturbance. 
Also, the cut u.30502 of the burial is the only one observed within the platform, and its infill looked bomogeneous. 

Although, the existence of a previous burial is not impossible. Indeed, lot of loose bones were found in the infill u.30503. Those could belong to one of the individual of burial 7127 (some of them are very disturbed by rodent activities) but also to a previous individual. In this case the older burial should has been completely destroy by the cut 30502.
The presence of two isolated cranium in the burial 7127 could maybe fit with such a hypothesis. But u.30512 is more likely understood as the secondary burial of a cranium as part of the multiple burial 7127. And the human remain team still has to determined if u.30515 fit with the loose bones. But the possibility that this cranium is also a secondary burial associated with 7127 cannot be excluded. 
Finally, it is also possible that both u.30515 and u.30512 are the very incomplete parts of the same cranium (which could be still either a secondary burial or a primary disturbed). 

The second reason is the very interesting conservation of the remain. Indeed, this burial has been very affected by the burning of building 52. But if the fire was very destructive for the architecture of the building, the material within the grave, protected by several layers of clay/plaster, in an anaerobic milieu, was not directly affected by the fire. It was \"baked\", or \"steamcooked\" (une cuisson à l'étouffée).
Some organic remains were thus preserved : textile (between u.30513 & u.30511, cf. u.30503, and on cranium of 30510), wood (\"boat-shaped bowl\" covering cranium of u.30513, and small artifact just above its feet), organic tissues (visceras and \"flesh\" for bay u.30511, brain for all the preserved cranium of the cut),   or \"fibres/roots\" in red-painted shells. 
This conservation led to very interresting results : specialists were able to identify linen/flax for the first time on the site. Because seeds of flax are absent in Catalhoyuk, the hypothesis of an imported textile from the Levant is plausible and has to be tested. Concerning the wood, the specialists identify maple which is very rare on site and probably exogenous. Concerning the brains, they are probably among the oldest known in world. 

This presence of brain in most of the preserved cranium is also a good argument for a single burial event. Indeed, all these individuals were not completely decomposed when the building was set on fire."^^xsd:string ;

Our first indication was that it was a basin because the white plaster under the packing was rounded scooped. Mira thought it could have been a storage basin. Later, however units 8104 and 6695 exposed a series of floors that seemed related to this white plaster. Thus, our interpretation changed to calling this a floor. We began chunking it out and discovered instead that the clay balls we had seen in the profile continued all the way across the underside of the white plaster. I exposed these balls across the entire unit. They are extremely fragile (don't seem to be fired at all) and break easily. The matrix is very crumbly and dry. The balls seem to be about 3 -ball layers deep, stood on top of one another.
This clay ball concentration was resting on a white plaster surface which rested on top of the south side of the oven F. 646. The bottom shows evidence of burning/ash perhaps due to its proximity to the oven (see unit #8194)."^^xsd:string ;

Small pit, half of it excavated 2012, but not grouped as a feature untill 2013.
This is a shallow pit which initialy has been recorded as burial, but no remains have been found within it. Although only half of the feature has been explored because of the section line that splits it into two parts (cannot excavate south part of the pit). Feature contains: infill (u. 19175) and cut (u. 19716). 

Discussion:
This is a shallow pit located beneath eastern - central platform (F. 3508) in Sp. 370 (B.96). Only some part (northern one) has been excavated. Southern part has been located beyond the section line and therefore it hasn't been explored. Within the fill there were evidence of a compression fill - the top layer was hard to distinguish and looked like make up. 
Definition of the cut (u. 19716) was clear. In the northern part there was evidence of another cut that cross - cut this one."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Feature is described as a pit, which is seen in part, to cut a series of midden layers, probably domestic dumping, and possibly also through burnt brick and old building materials. This could all be seen in the section sides of the pit as its layers were removed. The primary function of the pit is not clear. As it cuts through the above mentioned material there is a possibility that it has a quarry function with the objective to get at old building material. The secondary function of the pit seems clear, as it is filled with lens after lens of midden like material. Unit (12504) is of particular interest. It is a layer described best as a series of ashy like lenses of varying degree. The origin of the lenses is not clear but there is a possibility that they derive from oven and/or hearth rake out. 
All layers of the pit were dry sieved. Finds included: obsidian, animal bone, pottery, clay balls, bone points/needles, and clay figurines. 30 litres were also sampled for flotation from all units. It was hoped that the obsidian recovered from (12504) would give some indication for the origin of the lenses, as minute debitage is often indicavtive of rake out from ovens. No conclusive evidence was however forthcoming here.

Note on print out pictures of pit: print out (1) of the west facing section of the pit. It shows how the pit was excavated in its layer units. Arbritary layer units had to be excavated because of the extreme lensing into the pit. Broad areas were selected. The true stratigraphy of the pit and the broad events of its life history was however not revealed until completion of excavation. Print outs (2) and (3) show the broad stratigraphic history of the pit. It can be seen that unit layer (12558) has been added. This was a post excavation solution to slumping layer (12511) which occurred during the formation of (12504) spliting the layer. That is  (12504) and  (12588) are the same event. 

The broad stratigraphy of the pit suggests the following: 

(1) Cut 12518 of the pit possibly for quarry purposes. 

(2) Layer (12514) incompletly excavated due to it depth below 1.2m. It appears to be the primary like fill of the pit. Some rubbly chunks can be seen in the west facing section which probably represents instability of the feature sides. 

(3) Layer (12558) formation. It contains a very high quantity of thin ashy lenses. Some rubbly material can also be seen suggesting some continued instability of the surrounding space. 

(4) Layer (12511). A very homogenous layer, which is appears isolated to the north area of the pit. Its homogeniety suggsts a slump of some sort or a large dump. 

(5) Layer (12504). This is the continuation of (12558).

(6) Layer (12529). An earthy layer containg animal bone in high quantity. May have once spread out beyond the cut of the pit. Similar areas were noticed with excavation of (12502), and it seems quite likely that some of 12502 would have eroded into the pit. The layer is almost tertary like in it formation. 

(7) Layer (12501). Similar to (12529)."^^xsd:string ;

After these two phases of usage, the platform extension was covered with layers of packing and floors, and thus became part of platform F. 169.
 In the first phase four fire installations were in use at different points in time. Suggested sequence is: F. 778 >>F. 777>>F. 779>>F. 776, the last two maybe alternating. Floors around these features were frequently renewed (especially in the southwestern part), because they were constantly exposed to high temperatures. Different kinds of packing were placed under each floor, so they differ in colour and consistency. Fire and heat had different impact on them, considering both the vicinity of a certain fire installation, and texture of a packing itself. Floors were mostly made of yellowish sandy clay, plastered, but mostly damaged due to exposure to fire. More or less ten distinct floors were recognized in connection with these fire installations and of different states of preservation. In this stage, one tiny part of platform 169, almost hooklike, slightly curving to the south, separated central part of the house from this part of the kitchen (see sketch on feature sheet). 
In the second phase the extension was reduced in its northernmost part and previous fire installations covered with packing material. Then the hearths (F. 752, 630 and 604) took place of the earlier fire installations and were most probably used at the same time, or within a short time span, alternating. 
Finally, the hearths were abandoned and covered with packings and plaster floors, meaning that platform 169 was extended further to the east. The rest of the kitchen area kept its function, while fire place was moved to some other location."^^xsd:string ;

So, it's the thin replastering layer that made the lip. Plaster is a bit thicker in that southernmost part; it's present on the wall as well. Maybe they planned that corner for an oven later on (F.642). The feature is round in shape."^^xsd:string ;

Its bottom part, which was below the floor level (buried in the building foundation) was packed with plaster so a nice plaster mold of the post can be seen. Also, the wall plaster of the earliest phase/floors lies in the balk of this feature. Inbetween moulding and wall plaster there is a dark brown matrix (unit #8400). East side of this feature is in line with low bank set of F. 162 and F. 173. 

It is interesting to point out that this post is half tree trunk whereas post F. 766 was a complete tree trunk. This could mena that the F. 773 was not a structural post, and F. 766 was. 
The cut for the post was made in Phase I or II. In Phase III it was filled and no more posts were put in this place."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "This feature comprises one of at least three bins that are located along the wet wall of the building and in the center of the former space 158. The bin 780 is the top one and is attached to the west house wall.
All the bins are located right below the massive packing on top of which was the oven 646. Also they are all sloping from the west towards the center of the house (F. 606). 
Interesting thing about this feature is that has the original fill in it. The fill is soft, black, ashy soil. The bottom of the bin is completely covered with the fill, but the sides of the bin are not very high. They are rather, truncated down to the bottom. This seems to have happened to the other bins as well. The 780 is attached to the plaster of the west wall and it is unusual that it seems to be sealed by the upper floor plaster before the next floor on top was put in. That means that after the prehistoric people decided to remodel the area, they truncated the edges of the bins, did not empty F. 780, but sealed with the next floor up. 
The bin is made of clean beige colour clay and white plaster. The packing clay was used for building the bin and the plaster was applied on top of it. 
It is interesting that the F. 750 cut is sitting right on top of the northern edge of F. 780. We still don't know how the cut for 750 was made.
White plaster on top of this bin represented its last building phase (U #8417). After removal of that plaster very thick packing appeared, consisting of reddish brown clay, lumps pf plaster and red burnt material with charcoal and gypsum balls (especiallly in the W part). Underneath these layers we came down to the new floor from earlier phase (2nd) phase which is contemporary with the adjacent F. 781 and floor unit 8411. The bin from this phase was very well preserved. Next step was removing of the second phase plaster. Below it was a very thin layer of packing with surface covered with phytoliths and with an impression of matting. Removal of this layer gave way to the third, earliest phase of the bin. Plaster here was damaged, but obviously renewed by greasy orangish clay. This floor is stretching under the surrounding floor (unit 8411) and south wall of the bin is missing.
4th phase of this bin comprised white plaster floor and packing made of orangish brown sticky clay, as was the case in previous phases. 
Below this was 5th floor of the feature, consisting of white plaster, and rim remains, poorly preserved. It was almost impossible to distinguish between the bin floor and underlying, regular floor in this area. This thin layer was slightly sloping towards east."^^xsd:string ;

Lower part of pit filled with what appears to be redeposited floor and make up material, possibly redeposited when feature dug out. Then filled with ashy/ charcoal dump and above that deposits representing slumping of floors/ make up as the lower deposits subsided. Three groundstone and four obsidian artifacts recovered from throughout pit. Pit sealed by floor make up layer (12551).

Discussion
Pit could have been storage for a cache of obsidian and groundstone which was later recovered. A few items either missed or deliberately left. Original cut for storage pit presumably totallly removed by later retrieval cut or items placed under floor prior to laying of any make up of floor material, ie during construction phase??

Lips up against the oven F. 785. NE bin arm goes from the wall of the oven, so to speak, as seen on the sketch. Not quite sure yet whether it was there to use while using the oven (ash recipient?) or after. Fill of the bin contained nice pieces of building material, that is, oven material, most of which yellowish with flat surfaces. 
In the hole within the bin it is visible in the section that the rubbly layer is very thick, as already stated. It comes to mind that packing beneath the surface of bin: through all the oven phases superstructure material had been deposited there. 
Also, John Swogger suggested there might had been an obsidian cache in the hole as was the case in the south area.
With unit 8525 it became clear how the ash collecting bin was constructed. An oven base was redeposited and set as foundation for the bin. Also, hole in the middle was used as dump for oven superstructure and odd chunks of oven base.
Bin was sitting on top of floor, maybe mouth of oven F. 785 was producing too much ash and surrounding white floor needednto be kept clean."^^xsd:string ;

At least one basin feature was destroyed when making this cut (F. 782) and possibly the fourth basin feature as well. This basin would have been placed where unit #8444 was opened.
Cut has a very irregular shape. It is surrounded with F. 780 and F. 781; its west part lies below former F. 750 and central part is under F. 782. The fill consisted of reddish brown clay, under which a floor level was discovered, going under F. 780. On top surface of the fill there was a concentration of obsidian debitage. 
The northern half of the fill contained compact beige clay (unit #8444) in a layer of cca 3 cm below which is a floor like surface.
Southern half consists of mixed fill (unit #8436) in a 10-15 cm thick layer. It comprised of midden material, compact beige clay and chunks of white plaster. The compact layer and plaster are the remains of the cut for bin/basin F. 782.
It is not apparent why such a large cut had to be made. It is obvious that in the NE area of the cut there was a post installed, which was surrounded with large chunks of white plaster."^^xsd:string ;

The wall is cut by the construction of wall 403, but the top southern edge of wall 401 overhangs the lower part of wall 403, so wall 401 had to be taken down a bit in order to finish excavating wall 403 (that is the cut is at an angle). On the east face of wall 401 an oven (F.443) was partially cut and then plastered over, possibly to make a niche. Wall 401 was found to be cut by wall 403 [cut 4336], and continued southward at a lower level. On excavating down to the base it was discovered that at the southern end there was an extra course of mortar and brick. A cut 4396 had been made in the underlying fill and an extra lower level constructed. Packed up against this lower level (which was also plastered) was some silty clay brick like material + plaster which may have been used to give the wall greater stability. Slope of wall down to south and leaning to west. 
A large plaster lump had been constructed on the western edge of the wall at the northern end at the base of a large gap in the wall (see 99/103) which may have been an entrance between spaces.
When wall 73 was taken down it became clear that it was bonded to both wall 400 + wall 401 indicating that they were all constructed together and are the same wall. This is not surprising as all three are made of the same material whereas the later ones F.403 + 405 are made of different brick + mortar.

This wall therefore forms the dividing wall between spaces 159 to the west and 180 to the east in building 24.
To the north it's butt end forms the southern 'jamb' to access hole 589, but the construction at the base of the hole is continuous and bonds to wall 74 to the north. To the south it is cut by [4336], the construction cut for space 160. The wall itself sits in construction cut [4396], which steps down southwards , this is also mirrored in its opposite wall 400 to the west.

It's eastern face was cut to accommodate oven 443.

The severe lean  or overhang to the west appears to be original as the plaster facing reflects this lean with so signs of post-construction slumping. (sf)"^^xsd:string ;

This cut disturbed the cut of the pit and its fill, making it extremely difficult to distinguish-- also because in this same location, there was an earlier terracing cut [30229], for the construction of f. 3948 and its associated building. Because of all of these events, the basal boundary of pit f. 3986 was nearly impossible to determine, although it is somewhat more visible in section. Aside from these layered events, the pit's round shape is evocative of the late pits whose function remains enigmatic, as they do not usually contain many finds, nor do they show evidence of buring or storage activity at the basal boundary.

Foundation cut truncates EW portions of double wall below,F2840 and F2841.
Base of cut is in part firmed up by incorporation of a single mudbrick within fill (15434) which abutts wall F2840. Builders had cut down to a firm base with F2840 + F2841, but in this area it was fill so a single mudbrick formed a solid footing.

No individual mudbricks could be identified. The face of 2413 that shows towards space 340 is covered by a thin plaster line = 17241.

Relationship between posthole F1522 and cut [11345]. Not immediately apparent, however, as it is in base of cut and no other postholes visible it is probably related. Also suggest that post removed rather than decayed so deliberately removed prior to construction of wall F826.

Combined in post ex under F.825 (SF 28/09/11)

Below text is from F.1504
This feature represents a mudbrick wall first thought to be the western limit of Building 42. Initially seen in 2002 during excavations for the shelter footings, and was given F825, assumed to be a continuation of a wall found further to the south. However, the wall was renumbered due to evidence to suggest that this is actually an internal wall built at a later date across floor surface (10411). Only c.0.1m remains due to heavy truncation.
Given feature number F1504, but also given unit number (10410) to account for finds recovered from mudbrick make up.
Wall consisted of a single course and bricks were of a light reddish brown colour, suggesting either heat treatment or burning at some stage in their lives. Due to the high levels of truncation created by Mellaart in the 1960s, it is impossible to say what or why this wall was here, and what it was delineating. Was it a later inclusion to separate particular activities? Further to the south, there is a suggestion that the wall acts as some form of boundary (W) for hearth F1507, and ultimately a 'dirty' space. This however is not conclusive but may act as a suggestion as to the walls purpose. (GSC 10/07/2004)"^^xsd:string ;

The top of wall 401 leans over wall 403 and so had to be removed before the rest of wall 403 could be removed. Plaster on wall 400 continues southwards into the fill beneath wall 403, so it looks as if wall 400 was earlier, and was cut into to build wall 403.

This plaster stops at the level of the earliest floor in space 231 (unit 10810) and space 112 (unit 10806). Likewise the wall does not continue to a deeper level. The extant wall is only one brick high. Mellaart reconstructed a doorway along the western edge of f.1701, but no traces of a treshold remain at our level. It seems that wall f.1701 abuts the western wall of the building, f.267, as far as can be ascertained at present. In the NW corner of the space 112 the wall plaster on wall f.267 is directly connected to that on f.1701. There is no wall plaster on the interface between the two walls.

This is the final course of bricks of a wall; the others have been lost.  The wall is grey brown with no distinguishable mortar lines or individual bricks.  It sits on a layer of room fill (distinguished by different color and composition/texture).  The wall is clearly the remnants of a larger structure due to its very truncated nature (see discussion).  It is poorly made and variably straight

Discussion:
   This wall (F1605) is older than F1602 because F1602 cut through it at a later time.  F1605 is a continuation of F1755 because the coloration and texture of the walls are very similar.  In addition, the two walls final course of brick is similar in measurements.  Finally, the alignment of the two features is consistent with the premise that they are part of the same wall."^^xsd:string ;

This wall is bounded to building 46's eastern wall; it is quite apparent that the construction of these walls took place simultaneously.  The mortar binding the mud brick is a light grayish brown that has a crumbly structure to it.  Its thickness varies from 4 to 5 cms.  The bricks themselves are in different sizes; though this may be due to the extensive erosion and burrowing taking place that makes it difficult to distinguish the exact boundaries of the bricks.

This is part of a series of neonate and infant burials within this space, and the following is an extract from the Archive Report 2005 that explains all the ineterments in relation to each other:

\"These [burials] were investigated and proved to be the remains of many infantile skeletons buried under the floors close to the northern and southern walls. The burial F.2020 by the southern wall contained the bones of three neonates. The last one buried (10361) was lying on its left side in a crouched position. The definition of the burial cuts was not clear but it appears that (10361) was interred at the same time as the skeleton underneath (10370) with a third skeleton (10391) buried slightly earlier. By the northern wall two clearly defined burial cuts contained a single neonatal skeleton each. The eastern of these was F.2027 contained skeleton (10366) lying on its front with legs splayed. The western was F.2038 containing skeleton
(10390) lying on its back. Underneath these two burials were two further neonates; the upper of these skeletons (10368) had been badly disturbed by rodent activity. This burial may have been placed in the same cut as skeleton (10389) but it is difficult to be sure. Overall, Space 258 contained four neonates buried against the northern wall and three against the southern. As with the thick plastering around the walls in Space 227, the number of neonatal burials in the side room could be an indication of the length of time that the building remained in use.\""^^xsd:string ;

To the west (i.e. On the inside of the wall) there was no plastered surface or an obvious floor (U.7954, 7971) and the deposits are completely different, which suggests that this wall did seperate two different areas.  The bottom of the wall, on the west side, was unresolved, although it would appear as if there is a connecting plaster line on the current ground level that connects this partition wall with a similar one on the south wall.  However, this realtionship is unconfirmed.  U.7976 is the vertical plaster that appears to conect the partition wall with some upright post- pillar- or vertical support.
Unexcavated in 2004

Fully excavated Sep 2008. SF
This partition had the appearance of a bench but more than likely functioned as a partition which was constructed at the start of the building's life and continued throughout occupation sequence with modifications. 

The initial construction of mudbrick (17917) and mortar (17918) stood two clear courses high,  c. 025m high, 1.00m in length (up to truncation by animal burrow and brick width, 0.4m wide.  Constructed over the final levelling / make (17914) up in building below.

An upright (F.4004 was then added to the northern end against wall F.1655) on the eastern edge of the partition, so a narrow upright half width of partition. This was some 0.2m wide and 0.3m in length formed with bricks on edge. It seems that this upright was built against a shallow, earlier engaged pilaster formed of mortar but no associated plaster use was found. F.4004 could therefore be a modification to an earlier engaged pilaster

A fragmented layer of bricks was then added, clearly abutting  upright F.4004. 


A third course may have been truncated as evidenced by fragments of overlying brick. The partition and upright  was rendered on its surface and  sides by a thick blocky mortar (17920) and then the initial plaster render (17904) around the upright and across the partition in very patchy cover.

Whilst it lay in alignment with a shallow brick partion to the south (F1659, (17915)), which was also  laid at the initial layout of the building, the two constructions were different the southern division (17915) was a single course in depth and served as a kerb rather than a patrition with a superstructure (is this true in later sequence?), the two features were cut by an large animal burrow so a relationship was not gleaned.

It consists of a mas 8 courses, less in EW part, and is built with three brick types and two mortar types (see individual units). The brick and mortar types overlap illustrating that the wall is a sinble build with a range of resources and materials rather than rebuilds/ repairs.

Lower 4 courses contain a type of grey brick (15611) which is more familiar to some from L. VIII or L. IX ? In the south area, and have not been found in the 4040 before, which is considered to be in the later levels.

The eastern + southern faces are plastered, as is the northern + part of the NW corner suggesting this is an external wall

DISCUSSION
Wall, part of a structure, probably internal wall, as plastered on both sides.
Use of several brick and mortar types in construction. Particularly type familiar to lower levels in the South raises interesting questions: is this practical use of left over materials or a more symbolic action. Are the builders using whatever resources are available or are the sourcing specific materials. And so referencing specific people/ places/ buildings/ times. Or are these bricks in a structure that is extremely long-lived, or taken from one which is/was still extant, rather than quarrying for old bricks?

As building goes out of use F2841 is built before in filling (see F2841)
later both E/W parts of walls are built on by later structure represented by wall F2828."^^xsd:string ;

Cut not really defined until down to level of platforms F1525/1526. However was suspected from higher as western side of wall F1523 shows truncation. Plan 05/418 of room fill also shows poorly defined areas of looser room fill. So having literally got to the bottom, we now know what is going on. As excavation progressed this disturbance was recorded as cuts and fills where it was defined, otherwise room fill (11378) and layers (11376), (11372), (11369), (11367), (11366), (11347) which this cut disturbed have no real record of it and so are potentially contaminated with later material. Later pottery, both Byzantine and Chalcolithic have been recovered from some of these deposits.

Initially thought to be pits, feared to be a grave or retrieval pits but likelihood is that this is a large animal set or den. Interpretation as  animal disturbance does seem to explain the evidence in the best way; the irregular cut sides, fills similar to surroundings, looser fills, not being able to follow cuts from surface, truncation of wall F1523 from top and southern section showing disturbance from surface , and all the later pottery which has been showing up in some of the surrounding contexts.
It is the extent of this damage which is quite impressive but also disheartening as both platforms of B53 exposed, have suffered extensive damage."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "F. 1458 forms the S border of sp. 226 and separates the open space/street from the inhabited areas to the S. As we removed U. 8877 we reached the bottom of the wall in its westernmost part (the midden deposits were built against the wall).
F. 1458 is 10.5 m long, 0.40 m wide and the preserved height is 0.60-70 m (in the W part). It is a step-like (cascade wall), which apparently followed the midden (palaeo) surface. At this stage of excavation, 4 \"steps\" are visible (see digiplan 04.07). The wall slightly slopes down from W to E, the E part being at lower elevation.
In the W part F. 1458 is built on top of F. 1464 - 2 courses of bricks are put on top of an earlier wall (F. 1464). A thick layer of \"middeny\" mortar (9-14 cm thick) separates the two walls - F. 1458 and 1464. In the central part of the wall there are also 6 courses of bricks but in the E part the wall is eroded very much.
F. 1458 consists of mudbricks (and fragments of mudbricks), made of crumbly orange-brown clay - 70 x 40 x 9/10 cm. They are bonded by thin layers of ''middeny'' gray mortar.
The wall is very uneven, there is a brick protrudingg ca. 10 cm and the bricks are not very well aligned.
Most of the wall (except for its Wmost part) sits on the midden and had probably the same function as wall F. 1458 - to protect and separate the ''residence'' area to the S from the pressure of the midden. We have not reach its bottom in the E part of sp. 226.
 F. 1458 abuts wall F. 1416 and is abutted by  walls F. 1459 and 1460. It is truncated by a Late Roman burial (F. 1452) as well as by later cutç which is difficult to defineç because of the erosion.
F. 1458 is very much eroded, especially in its E part (because it was too close to the surface).
This wall existed for a long period of time and probably it has been repaired and overbuilt many times. It is difficult to reconstruct all the construction phases, major and smaller repairs it went through because the wall has suffered a lot from erosion and later cuts (e. g. there is one course of bricks on top of the central part of both F.1458 and F.1416, which consists of mudbricks made of sandy light brown mudbrick different from the crumbly bricks of F. 1458. It was probably aimed at repairing a damaged part).
Wall F. 1458 was built at some point, when a certan amount of midden was accumulated, therefore it is contemporary to its later levels (U. 8892, 8877, 8869. 8864, 8859, 8854, 8853)

The mudbricks are made of yellow sandy clay, sometimes bonded by thin layer of mortar (which was most probably taken from the surrounding midden).
F. 1459 was made predominantly of pieces of mudbricks, clumsily arranged. Its highest point is ca. 35 cm above the current surface of the midden (U. 8877).
The function of the wall is not clear - it probably represented or was related to some kind of activity, which has taken place or has been related to the midden. It seems a bit earlier than F. 1458 (a piece of the cow's skull was place on top of F. 1459 and below a protruding mudbrick of F. 1458).
On top of the W part of F. 1459 a skull of a cow, chopped into 3 pieces and piece of a long bone (U. 8880) were dumped.
It the easternmost part of the wall we came across a relatively big patch (N-s 70 cm; E-W 85 cm) of bricks, which were fallen (dumped) from the wall and have been destroyed.
NB! The hypothesis that F. 1459 is a \"supportive\" wall for F. 1458 does not seem very probable. I think that the two featores are related to different events ."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "F. 1464 was assigned to an earlier wall, which is below wall F.1458 (and later became part of it).
F. 1464 is situated in the SW corner of sp. 226. Later it was overbuilt by wall F.1458.
F. 1464 is 2.10 m long (W-E) but it extends to W, and is 0.47 m high.
It consists of 4 courses of mudbricks and mudbrick fragments, not very carefully arranged. They are made of sandy light brown clay – 76 x 40 x 8 cm.
There are several thicker bricks (10 cm) and a plaster slab/brick. The bonding material is 2-6 cm thick and consists of gray ‘’middeny’’ mortar.
Wall F. 1464 sits on the midden and after removal of U. 8877 we reached its bottom. The wall is quite irregular and is slightly slanting down from E to W.
F. 1464 is separated from F. 1458 by a thick (9-14 cm) layer‘’of middeny’’ mortar.
F. 1464 abuts F. 1416.
As F. 1464 is not completely excavated I am not completely certain about its function. Most probably it protected the inhabited territories to S from the pressure of the midden.
F. 1464 is contemporary to the later levels of the midden deposit (from 8877 up).
An open fire place is visible in the section of F. 14641458 (see description in unit sheet 8877)."^^xsd:string ;

The wall appears to be made from mixed building debris compacted into an uneven layer, which is only <0.3m thick in the western side. Despite the uneven nature of the structure it is plastered on the inside. Below it is visible another even more vertical surface which may represent an earlier phase of the same midden retainer - it is as yet unexcavated.

Further excavation in 2013 by a. klimowicz:
Feature 3626 was assigned as the Northern wall of the Sp.488. Its construction was the most complicated comparing other walls of the mentioned structure. Especially in the term of a number of building techniques applied. It became clear that the lower layers of the wall were set against the common constructional rules maintained wherever on site. Due to lack of space that was restricted by already existed walls (from the south F.3646, and from the north F.3096), builders were forced to load reused bricks and paste them using mortar probably directly throwing mixture into prepared before foundation cut. Consequently, in the course of the exploration it was possible to evidence broken bricks of different texture placed in varied position that were immersed in irregular paste of mortar. 
Removing several layers of the wall exposed the relationship between F3626 and the superstructure of the oven (F.7108) of B.77. Worth noticing is that, before erecting the wall (F. 3626) builders covered whole above mentioned fire installation using only mortar material coating the dome of the structure. In other words the construction F.3626 respects the oven, therefore the wall has later origins than the fire installation. During farther constructional phases builders did not care about the vertical line of the wall in its central level. It is clear that it was difficult to maintain the straightness in the extremely narrow space 488. Additionally, re-using the broken bricks was the significant factor of the final disheveled form of F.3626. The appearance was not as important as in typical buildings, because the describing part of the feature was plausibly immediately covered by the infill (u. 19580, 20486) that wrapped whole sp.488, creating at the same time suitable base/ground for erection above structure B.108."^^xsd:string ;

Described as such because of the high number of carbonized branches in it.  It is possible that it was a basket but the doubt comes from the fact that there were no branches on the bottom, on the floor.

It was placed directly on floor 2041, in the southeastern corner. The floor is lower in that area, exactly to fit 2040 \"basket\" in it.

The cluster in 11965 contained a number of stones, 2 obsidian blades, and a large number of sheep long bones plus antlers, some of which worked.

Therefore I see 2040 as a possible basket, but definitely a storage area, maybe for bones which were about to be worked into bone tools.  This is argued also by the fact that the long bones are very suitable for that purpose and also by the presence of a big stone on floor 2091, which presents signs of working."^^xsd:string ;

The function of the pillar is not immediately clear. It is not placed in a corner where pillar scars are more common in the spaces of Buildings. By the scar would have perhaps have been 10-15 cm wide by 0.10cm deep. This size is relatively quite small and may not have been used as a main support structure. Its placement in the house matrix (before floor & wall plastering) suggests that it was however integrated into the main design of the house/building.
The pillar scar suffers from severe animal activity. This has distrubed the would be fill (12589) of the pillar scar subsequent to its removal."^^xsd:string ;

F. 1460 is poorly preserved due to the erosion (it was too close to the surface). It consists of 2 (3) courses of pale orange-brown bricks, made of crumbly clay. The bricks are 6-7 cm thick and are bonded by gray mortar. The current height of the wall (SE corner of sp. 226) is 29 cm.

F.2160 consists of parts of three skeletons ((12359), (12360), (12385)) found in a secondary burial context. The bones were co-mingled, the long bones being concentrated together as were the crania, only few of them appearing to be in roughly articulated position. All evidence suggested that the skeletons were disturbed from their initial position and re-buried. It is possible that the remains were placed in a shallow cut (very difficult to identify during excavation being so close to the surface and therefore disturbance), or the remains were part of a ‘clearance’ dump alongside roman tegulae and mortar that was also found in the fill.

From Archive Report 2007 ::

The sequence starts at formation level with two walls: F.2835 and F.2837. It is likely that F.2837 pre-dates wall F.2835 for reasons that will be described later. It appears that F.2835, an east-west aligned mudbrick wall, comprising of units (15484) (mudbricks) and (15485) (mortar), is somewhat anomalous to this area of the site in that the mortar, having a light cream, marl rich consistency, has mainly only been observed in buildings in the South Area (but also noted in FT 7). The full dimensions of the mudbricks remains unknown as they were only partially exposed and excavated and extending into the west of the foundation trench (about 0.25m) but appeared to be composed of a light yellowish brown, fine sandy silt matrix with little or no
inclusions. F.2835 whilst not being exposed to its foundations was exposed to a greater extent than F.2837, aligned in a rough North-South orientation for the length of the trench and had slumped heavily to the east. The mudbricks (15475) consisted of a firm light yellowish brown fine sandy silt measuring 0.6m x 0.4m x 60mm) and the mortar (15476) a firm dark greyish brown clayey silt."^^xsd:string ;

The wall is built of narrow bricks, of gray-brownish color made of very sandy clay. The mortar is light grey in colour. The bricks and mortar are uniform in colour and consistency. No openings or blocked openings were noticed. The plasters on the wall were different. On the west wall face the plaster was thinner (cca 1 cm in thickness) whereas on the east face the plaster was much thicker.

From Archive Report 2007 ::

The sequence starts at formation level with two walls: F.2835 and F.2837. It is likely that F.2837 pre-dates wall F.2835 for reasons that will be described later. It appears that F.2835, an east-west aligned mudbrick wall, comprising of units (15484) (mudbricks) and (15485) (mortar), is somewhat anomalous to this area of the site in that the mortar, having a light cream, marl rich consistency, has mainly only been observed in buildings in the South Area (but also noted in FT 7). The full dimensions of the mudbricks remains unknown as they were only partially exposed and excavated and extending into the west of the foundation trench (about 0.25m) but appeared to be composed of a light yellowish brown, fine sandy silt matrix with little or no
inclusions. F.2835 whilst not being exposed to its foundations was exposed to a greater extent than F.2837, aligned in a rough North-South orientation for the length of the trench and had slumped heavily to the east. The mudbricks (15475) consisted of a firm light yellowish brown fine sandy silt measuring 0.6m x 0.4m x 60mm) and the mortar (15476) a firm dark greyish brown clayey silt."^^xsd:string ;

It was also noted that the western edge of hearth f.3531 extenuated underneath a layer of plaster initially left as part of a built edge adjacent to the hearth.  This may represent some upkeep of the platform on which hearth f.3531 lies which changed its shape either after or during its use.  This lends support to the assertion that this hearth may have been less integral to the longterm functioning of th ehouse than the more centrally-situated hearths.

Unit assigned to the surface of space 88 revealed outlines of this wall and the cut in the west wall (between spaces 88 and 87) made by a Byzantine grave (F. 151). Regarding wall between spaces 88 and 89, scraping of the west wall of 89 showed that there was no wall plaster, and the bricks at the top are irregular and eroded. After defining the south and the north ends of this wall (163), it was tried to distinguish between solid wall and possible opening between spaces 88 and 89 (recognized by intensive burning and different soil). Continuing the excavation, it became clear that instead of an opening this could be a niche in the eastern wall of space 88. It was filled with bricky and burnt material. It is also possible that the original connection between these two spaces was blocked by building a wall on the side of space 89.
East wall of the space 88 is made of regular rows of bricks and layers of mortar . It was partly damaged when F. 151 (Byzantin burial) was dug into it. Next to the later burial cut there is the above mentioned niche-like structure/opening?

Munsel chart for the bricks: 7.5 YR 6/4; for the mortar 10 YR 4/2, 10 YR 2/1
Dimensions of the top bricks: 0.60x0.50x0.06 m

The bricks of this wall resemble those of the south and the north wall of space 88, as well as mortar. Southern portion of the wall is exposed to moisture, which makes this area look darker in colour and soil greasy, moist, not so firm and full of salts. The colour of the bricks in southern half is orange brown, while in northern half it's light, light brown, almost beige. Bricks are made of very sandy clay. 
Mortar is midden-like (with inclusions such as charcoal bits, gypsum, salts, pieces of animla bones, burnt clay and small stones), light grey in north and black in south half of the wall. The lowest layer of mortar lies underneath the last row of bricks and directly on top of an earlier ('black-bricked') wall. 
For detailed description of bricks and mortar see units #8667 (brick) and # 8668 (mortar). 
Regarding possible niche/opening in the upper part of the peserved wall, it hasn't been defined while removing the wall, so it will stay unclear whether it actually existed."^^xsd:string ;

In 1999 this feature was referred to as an internal wall of space 88. The soil between this and the south wall of the space was full of charcoal, plaster lumps, burnt ground stone , which might served to consolidate the small bin-wall (unit #6126). Reddish floor with black packing underneath (unit #6242 - 3rd floor) go underneath the internall wall, which means that they are earlier. With unit #6245 this feature was removed. Two large samples (S3 and S4) were taken for building material. In the base of this feature was white surface of clay. The wall itself was made of orangish sandy moist clay, same as the one use for the bricks of the south wall of the space 88. 
Since this feature was truncated and not connected to any other feature in space 88, it will remain unclear what it served for. It could be that it was not found in situ, which makes the interpretation even harder."^^xsd:string ;

It looks as if there is a north-south plaster line at the current level of excavation that connects to the partition wall on the northwest wall (F. 1654).  This wall is only plastered on the east face.  On the unplastered west face there is a black line that appears to be at the base of its construction because the line is at the same level on the east face.  From this I assume that the partition wall is later than the deposits underneath, which are distinctly different.  It also looks as if this partition wall has cut through F.1652 because the bin walls abruptly end but the determing unit (U.7968) has been left unexcavated.

Unexcavated in 2004

Excavated in 2008 by DE, CM, and LF.  The partition wall was excavated, revealing a plaster post-like structure (14454) that had red paint applied.  This post was built over the edge of platform f. 1666.

Internal wall comprised of several different layers of make up. Wall was heavily degraded and ephemeral at best, after several seasons of exposure and conservation.

As with the neighbouring wall F.3679, the eastern end of the wall was probably cut off when the wall F.3627 was erected.

In 2013 feature was excavated by A. Klimowicz:
The reason of erection of the wall F.3646 along the northern face of existing counterpart structure (F.3679) remains still unclear. The feature did not have any relation with uncovered units and it was not bonded with any structure at least in its Eastern section. Therefore, interpretation involving construction of the wall with the kind of retaining purpose is still the most plausible. In that case the feature might have been built to keep F.3679 from collapsing on to B.77 (see Archive Report 2012, p:25)."^^xsd:string ;

In the SE corner, there seems to be another baby burial which makes the skeleton numbers '4'.
The units 11957 and 11971 are very close to each other and given an impression of same date of burial.
By 02.08.05, after taking out 4 baby skeletons, another skeleton appeared in the fill.

  c:description "This feature was found as a concentration of stones after removing a fill which lay over this as well as feature F3699. This feature cuts F3699 to its western side and otherwise it cuts the floor u20909. In the pit we found a concentration of ground stones of which two were nice complete tools . Also some animal bones were found. The whole feature was excavated with trowel. Unfortunately no articulation of the stone fragments could be observed due to miscommunication between excavator and student. However prior to this, it was already noted that there were many stones and that they were seemingly packed. But it is not asserted.

The ground stones in the fill all derive from tools; most are quern fragments but two were nice and fully functional polishing stones ( one is X1) of which one is certainly for polishing plaster. The cut of the pit was made symmetrically; semirectangular with rounded corners, but the fill had spread out some. All fill was sampled.

Anyway, the feature is clearly a pit with fill of stones and soil. The question is whether it is a deliberate deposition or not. The inclusions of ground stone (worked) and fully functional, and very nice, tools for polishing plaster speaks for the former as well as the small size and confinement to the basinlike feature and floor. Perhaps it could even be connected to F3699 more precisley, presumably in the final use/abandonment stage."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "F. 1453 was defined as a wall at the  beginning of the excavation, while cleaning the top soil layer. However, we are not able to define it properly, because we did not excavated the fill of sp. 243 (U. 8894). But we removed a layer to the S of F. 1453 ca. 30-50 cm thick (U. 8876, 8892) and released the S face of the wall. It seems that it is a double wall, consisting of S wall and N wall (but it was given one F number because we are not certain about it).
It seems that the S part/wall is quite shallow - it consists of 2(3) courses of mudbricks - the first course consists of light brown crumbly mudbricks (made of finer clay with lower amount of sand) and the second one (lower) is made of yellowish-brown mudbricks (made of sandy clay).It is not clear whether this difference is a result of 2 different construction periods/phases or different types of bricks were used for some reason for the construction of the wall.
The N part of F. 1453 once had a plastered face (the interior face) and traces of plaster are still visible at the SW corner of the sp. 243 (the plaster was not given an U number(. The plaster is ca. 2 cm thick and consists of fine white clay.
If F. 1453 really consists of 2 walls, the S one is probably a later one, aimed at supporting the N one - the real wall of sp. 243. This suggestion seems to be supported by the fact that the S part of F. 1453 sits on top of midden and is shallower than the N one.
F. 1453 runs from  W to E and slopes down from W to E (from 1012.14 to 1011.77). There are traces of white clay/plaster on top of it (the central part) and traces of light gray brick in the easternmost top part (see the plan).
The easternmost part of F. 1453 (where it is supposed to bond F. 1461) was cut by U. 8881, 8886 and 8889. For that reason the relation between  F. 1453  and F. 1461 remains uncertain."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "F. 1454 was initially associated with the odd \"half-arch\" construction (U. 8874). Trying to figure out what it is like, I removed one course of bricks. It became clear that this is a wall running in N-S direction. It is not completely excavated, so few things can be said about it.
Most probably it forms the W boundary of sp. 243. The wall was truncated by F. 1455 (L. Roman burial), which provided a section of F. 1454. 4 or 5 courses of bricks are visible in the this section. The bricks are made of brown sandy clay, they are 70 x 40 x 8 cm and are bonded with grey mortar.
Another two courses of bricks abutted F. 1454 to the E. Initially we thiught it is a double wall but after excavating F. 1455, which provided a nice section, it appears that the E row of bricks is not a part of a wall but it is some kind of a construction. A platform or a bench probably abutts F. 1454 (visible in the section).
It seems that F. 1454 runs below F. 1462.
NB! Yet we should have in mind that it could be a double wall.

Is in northwest corner of building 57, space 269. Eastern edge is bounded by plaster ledge/partiion. A small bead was also found.

DISCUSSION:
Small niche between wallls may have bee plastered over at one point (plastered edge was several cm in height). Fill was rich in organic material. Excavation commenced as part of unit 12124, stopped, and was assigned unit number 12129 when it became clear that deposit was a cluster and probably intentional. Finds were given x find numbers so they could be linked with earlier finds from 12124.

Finds include worked stone \"loom weight\", large mandible (34 cm max length), flint core. Some finds were on/below plaster ledges attached to the various walls. \"Loom weight\" was underneath a ledge in the undercut area. Three to four ledges were present, still attached to the wall and continuous with the wall plaster. These might have been shelves. We guess that this deposit may represent part of the \"domestic tool kit\" (?)

Speculation: plaster ledge may represent edge to which late floors were laid, leaving basin area behind it. Top of ledge might have been associated with late floor which was destroyed prior to infilling or during the process."^^xsd:string ;

From Archive Report 2007:

[The earliest excavated feature within this trench was a \"double\" wall, or rather two parallel walls F.2820 and F.2821.] They were both laid in a north-south orientation and extended from the northern L.O.E continuing into the eastern L.O.E with the butt ending roughly 1.0m south from this. The bricks in the western wall F.2820 measured 1.0m x 0.32m x 80mm and were formed from firm light greyish brown fine sandy silt. The mortar was up to 20mm thick and consisted of firm, mid brownish grey sandy silt. There was only one brick visible within the L.O.E and no mortar. This brick (15097) was made from firm, light yellowish brown sandy silt. Another ‘double wall’ directly overlaid F.2820 and F.2821 but extended across the length of the trench in a N-S direction and as with F.2820 was only one course high with the eastern extent of the wall continuing into the eastern L.O.E."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "This wall was only partly exposed since it continued in to the section 12/915. Ten layers of grey bricks could be counted. The lengths of the bricks are c. 0,7-0,9m and the thickness 0,05-0,07m. The mortar was yellow and between 0,01-0,05m in thickness. At the northern side of the wall, where it was in contact with wall F.3646, wall plaster could be seen at a length of 1,10m.  The layer of plaster was 0,04m thick and 14 thin layers could be counted. The eastern end of the wall was probably cut in the eastern end when the wall F.3627 was erected. There are indications in the sondage trench U.19591, that the wall continues at least 0,3m deeper than the exposed 0,82m.

2013 EXCAVATION SEASON:
In 2012 from stratigraphical and recording points of view the wall F.3679 was associated with the Sp.489. However, in 2013 after revealing its entire southern face it appeared that the feature really is the northern wall of the earlier structure recorded as Sp.511. It has been preserved up to 2,1m height and at the time remains the highest construction/feature within the mentioned Space. The others walls (F.7125, F.7126) are twice lower than F. 3679. It is made of dark-grey bricks and orange clay mortar in its lower part. However there are noticeable alterations within the texture of the mortar used within upper section which is composed mostly of sandy-silt and differ distinctively from described above. The southern face of the wall is coated by a single layer of light-grey plaster that covers the construction only up to 1,10 height. The latter might give an insight into the long-term of unroofed exposure or unpleasant conditions that effected the wall. One may assume that the wall F.3679 is actually a division construction between mentioned side-room (sp.511) and a main-room located northward. The structure behind the wall has been currently registered under the number: 518 and its exploration has not been accomplished in 2013 (see unit sheet 30137). Therefore, the entire nature of the wall (its northern side) remains unknown."^^xsd:string ;

F.482 is an e-w wall, dividing Sp. 178 and Sp. 179, within Building 23 - level 10. Bonds with F.507, the n-s parti. wall to the east of F.482. To east of centre of F.482 is crawlhole F.530, which is plaster lined. The plaster is part of 4512 - a single application, which also lines the north and south faces of F.482, so the crawlhole was built as an integral part of the wall. Attached to the south face, or immediately south of the south face, are features: F.531, 532, 559, and 560. See overleaf. F.482 may bond with F.509, the n-s wall to the west. This relationship - as yet uninvestigated.
Discussion:  Features F.559 (niche), and F.560 (wall painting), were a plaster-lined niche and assoc. painting, attached to the south face of F.482. It is uncertain whether F.559 is integral to F.482. It is built into a 'scoop' into F.482, but there is no evidence of damage to the brickwork. Bench? F.531, and bin F.532 are not part of F.482, but are presumably assoc. with activity in and around F.559. (See Adnan for unit sheets for these features.)"^^xsd:string ;

From Archive Report 2007:

FT 08 
Founded directly on the walls (F.2813 and F.2814)  described above was another ‘double wall’, again aligned in a N-S orientation but slightly more to the west, running trough the centre of the trench. The western wall F.2806 stood six courses high where its western face was slightly battered. The bricks (15042) used to construct F.2806 measured 1.8m x 0.30m x 90mm and were made from very firm, light yellowish brown sandy silt. The corresponding mortar (15043) was a very firm/compact, light brownish grey, sandy silt up to 30mm thick. The bricks (15044) used in the eastern wall F.2807 were of the same fabric as (15042) but were slightly smaller. Again, the mortar (15045) used in this wall was the same as that used in the western wall F.2806. The eastern wall F.2807 did not stand as high with only four and a half courses surviving.

FT 09
Constructed over this roomfill was double wall F.2806 and F. 2807, which was visible in the section of FT 8. The walls ended at the same level, thus, with the small view of them in the trench, the stratigraphic relation was hard to tell. The western wall F.2806 turned to the east, while it is hard to tell what happened with the eastern wall F.2807. The bricks (15463) of wall F.2806 were a similar shade (orange-brown) and texture (firm clay) as the bricks (15461) in wall F.2807. The mortar (15464) of wall F.2806 was a similar shade (a light grayish brown) and texture (clayey) as the mortar (15462) in wall F.2807. Both walls were 0.35m in height, and had 4 coursings of brick. The fill on the other side of wall F.2807 was not given a unit number as that there was only a sliver of it exposed in the foundation trench. There was no fill between walls."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Description

This is a quite large pit located next to western wall (F. 4090) of space 370 (B.96).  It has been filled with numerous inclusions especially with a cluster of animal bones (u.19702) and a relatively big concentration of white and creamy plaster. 

Discussion

This is a quite large pit located next to western wall (F. 4090) of space 370 (B.96).  It has been filled with a massive amount of plaster which probably fell down from the western wall. Within the pit cluster of animal bones (u.19702) has been recorded. At the bottom of the pit fragments of red ochre has been registered and removed for specialist analyses. It is possible that this feature is a post retrieval pit. Its position directly next to the central part of western wall of the building can indicate this kind of function of the feature. Lack of plaster on the wall just above the pit suggest that it could be some sort of constructional element assembled to the wall. The cut (u.19704) of the pit was ovoid and regular with a sharp edge, vertical sides and a flat base."^^xsd:string ;

Five courses of bricks were visible at each end, though individual bricks within the courses were more difficult to define.  The north bricks are mid-brown in colour with a coarse crumb texture and only very occasional flecks of charcoal.  The south end appears similar.  The brick courses are 0.05 to 0.09m high.

The mortar is greyer in colour with a dense, compact consistency and sparse/moderate flecks of orange brick, white plaster and charcoal (to c. 10mm) and occasional fragments of bone and shell.  The thickness of the mortar varies from 0.02 to 0.07m.

It lay immediately north of e-w wall F.299, which represents the southern boundary of the midden. The wall consisted mainly of only two courses of brick and mortar, but within it's central area, a 'block' of wall extended downward for a further two courses  - see overleaf. There were small remnants of plaster facing, surviving on both the north and south face of the wall. These remnants, only up to 0.60m in length, lay opposite each other, toward the western limit of F.503.
Discussion: F.503 was a roughly built, (and often hard to define), wall. The deposits below the wall, looked like wall collapse or demolition debris, onto which the wall was constructed. The purpose of the 'block' sketched above is uncertain, though I understand it's not an uncommon occurrence. (Unfortunately, we've lost the e-w dimension of this section of wall). The two areas of plaster facing, lieing opposite each other on the north and south wall faces, may be assoc. repair work, rather than remnants of complete plaster faces. We suspect that F.503 was built as a reinforcing wall, to consolidate the southern limit of the midden area."^^xsd:string ;

What we thought at first to be due to erosion since 2005, was in fact a very clear cut in the red layer.
It is not completely clear at what exact moment during the use of the platform the pilaster/pedestral was removed and the cut u.20941 filled up with the layer u.20674. 
Although, this layer of fill is not a make-up layer of the type used in the platform. Also, it is burnt and it is thus older than the burning of building 52. The pilaster/pedestral was thus already removed when building 52 was set on fire. 
Also, at least the upper layers of arbitrary layers u.20615 were covering it. It is thus reasonable to think that the pedestral/pilaster was removed and the cut filled either when layer u.20634 was cut for the burial f.7112 and covered by u.20615. Because the kerb f.3693 was covering a little bit the fill 20941, because it was not destroyed by the removal, and because this kerb was itself partially covered by layer u.20615, this proposition seems to be most accurate. 
It was possible to interpret this cut in the platfrom as the print of a removed pilaster/pedestral by comparison with already known pilaster/pedestral in the site.The size and the emplacement fit with the type of pedestral used to hold, for instance, a pair of bull horns.

FT 08 
Founded directly on the walls (F.2813 and F.2814)  described above was another ‘double wall’, again aligned in a N-S orientation but slightly more to the west, running trough the centre of the trench. The western wall F.2806 stood six courses high where its western face was slightly battered. The bricks (15042) used to construct F.2806 measured 1.8m x 0.30m x 90mm and were made from very firm, light yellowish brown sandy silt. The corresponding mortar (15043) was a very firm/compact, light brownish grey, sandy silt up to 30mm thick. The bricks (15044) used in the eastern wall F.2807 were of the same fabric as (15042) but were slightly smaller. Again, the mortar (15045) used in this wall was the same as that used in the western wall F.2806. The eastern wall F.2807 did not stand as high with only four and a half courses surviving.

FT 09
Constructed over this roomfill was double wall F.2806 and F. 2807, which was visible in the section of FT 8. The walls ended at the same level, thus, with the small view of them in the trench, the stratigraphic relation was hard to tell. The western wall F.2806 turned to the east, while it is hard to tell what happened with the eastern wall F.2807. The bricks (15463) of wall F.2806 were a similar shade (orange-brown) and texture (firm clay) as the bricks (15461) in wall F.2807. The mortar (15464) of wall F.2806 was a similar shade (a light grayish brown) and texture (clayey) as the mortar (15462) in wall F.2807. Both walls were 0.35m in height, and had 4 coursings of brick. The fill on the other side of wall F.2807 was not given a unit number as that there was only a sliver of it exposed in the foundation trench. There was no fill between walls."^^xsd:string ;

No installation was found for this combustion location: it resembles a hunter-gatherer camp fire. The walls of the cut were very clayish and no layering was visible in their section, which raises the possibility that the clay was intentionally placed against the walls of the pit for controlling the spread of heat and the risk of setting the building on fire (was there a roof at the time?). The walls and bottom of the pit show signs of rubefraction (reddish colour), but the presence of charred plant remains and the absence of further changes in the sediment seem to indicate that this was a low temperature fire. The absence of internal layering in U.20961 and sediment deposition point to the possibility that this was a single burning event. Towards the base of the pit, a concentration of grass-like phytolihs was found. 
The S half of U.20961 consisted of dispersed ashes and burnt plant materials. The (clayish) sediment in this area was heavily cracked, which might suggest, again, heat impact. 
No animal remains or artefact were encountered. 
This feature seems to represent an 'opportunistic' activity area and there is not clear explanation for this behaviour. The fact that the ashes were not brushed and that floors were built directly on top of this feature might point towards the possibility that this feature is related to ritual activities of some sort."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "South wall of space 89 is built of two different types of bricks: predominant are the bricks made of sandy, loose clay of a orangish brown colour with inclusions such as salts and bits of reddish matter, maybe some mineral found in clay. The second type would be bricks of a red brown colour, more compact, also made of sandy stuffed clay, but of a somewhat different texture, maybe of scorched soil. First three rows of bricks that are preserved were mad eof this kind of bricks.
Mortar is made of blackish middeny soil with inclusions such as charcoal and salts, and is hitherto thicker than expected (probably patching the gaps). 
In the western part of the wall rows of bricks are not completely regular, they slightly slide up and down. Also, at the SW bottom end of the wall the bricks are missing - this portion is filled with compact middeny soil, and the whole wall is actually sitting on a midden. 
12 rows of bricks were preserved. The thickness of bricks is around 9 cm. 
Munsell chart for the bricks is 7.5 YR 6/4, 7.5 YR 5/5, 7.5 YR 5/6; for mortar it's 7.5 YR 5/2.
At first it looked as if this wall is contemporary with the south wall of the space 88, but after scraping the surface between spaces 88 and 89 and comparing the the colour and thickness of bricks, it became clear that these two walls have nothing in common. 
Later on, when we removed east wall of space 88 (F. 163) and started removing east wallof space 89 (F. 1016), the situation became clearer. Bricks of F. 761 and F. 1016 interlace, and they are made of the same kind of soil, which indicate that they were built at the same time. Also, it is very likely that F. 1017 is contemporary with F. 761 and F. 1016, because their bricks are interlocked.

2003 notes (SM):
North-south aligned wall made up of bricks (unit #8654) and four different types of mortar (units #8655, 8659, 8660 and 661). Given that thick, firm mortar runs through all the walls of space 201, and same bricks that were used to construct the walls, it is obvious that bricks were laid contemporaneously, bonding walls at all four corners. 
10 courses of bricks of this wall survived. 
Wall F. 762 encloses opening (F. 633) t the north and niche (F. 768) to the south. Both features were blocked at some point probably due to to constructing the wall F. 1023 to the east.

still undetermined. 

4.7. 2007, TEB+HSL: Part of one layer of mudbricks were accidentally removed. In clearing away remaining top soil areas, a layer was exposed and 'followed', which subsequently turned out to be a hard surface (second layer of mudbricks?) underneath the very 'friable' mudbricks. The remaining undisturbed mudbricks have been left and the area generally brushed down until further discussion. A photo, fortunately, was taken before the catastrophe occurred.

14.8.2008, AWH: Like seen in 2006, the wall has two rows of mudbricks. By taking out the roomfill of space 310 we found a second layer of plaster behind plaster 13726 which was named 17249. It ends 30cm deeper than 13726 and there are indications of red colour on its surface.

26.8.2009 JMR: When further excavating the rrom fill in space 310, we noticed that wall F.2408 had already been undercut last year. Under it there is a layer of fill U.18353 and underneath an older wall F.3313 with roughly the same orientation - this belongs to an older phase of Sp.310. Total preserved height 0.9m.

22.8.10 JMR: F.2408 forms the northern limit of Sp. 310. It consists of dark grey bricks and pale yellow mortar. Bricks visible in plan. Feature cut in section in 2010 (see photos) for stratigraphical clarification and upper part removed for stability and safety. Height indicated above (ca.50 cm) is original height. Wall was standing on fill and an earlier wall F. 3313 (see 09/254).
  Dismantling of upper part of 2008 (22.8.2010) was documented in photos, samples were taken.
  Bricks visible in plan - dark mortar used for vertical filling. Bricks seem 38+37-65 cm, but disturbed by rodents. A gap of 4-5 cm separates 2408 and 5056. Might be binding into F.2427 and 5058. As bricks seem stacked in those corners brick contained quite large fragments of animal bone, pot, shell and burnt plaster."^^xsd:string ;

The cut itself is oval and long, stretching from the southern edge of the platform F. 162 almost to the northern edge of platform F. 169. It is parallel with central space of building 3 (F. 606).  
At the beginning and the end of the cut (north and soth) the posts are of larger diameter (F. 608 and 624). The posts in between are smaller in size (see unit 8572 for description of the cuts). It was a wattle-and-daub construction, consisting of 7 main posts. A narrow ditch (15-30 cm) was dug in the beginning and after that the beds for the posts were made. The average depth of the postholes from top of the midden layer is 50/55 cm. The posts were slanting from W to E (probably because the floor was santing from E to W). The ditch wa sfilled with fine clay to fix the posts. There are traces of white plaster and brown packing at the ditch section.

The wall was built with hard red crumbly clay bricks, measuring ca. 18 cm wide, 6 cm in height, the length varies, but about 80 cm seems to be most common. The mortar in between the bricks is ca. 2 cm thick, and consists of beige-gray greasy clay. The same was used to apply plaster coating on the top and the side surface of the wall, so that the preseved condition of the wall might be reflecting that of the past.
Wall 1000 is cut by pit 750. It is probably the same as wall 635, to the south (the two are separated by 750). This wall 635 is plastered with lime, whrere as 1000 is not, reflecting perhaps a different use of this part of the house.
The wall 1000 is probably to be interpreted as shoring wall to consolidate the western wall of building 3, 622/636, which is sagging inwards.
As the wall was entirely covered by mortar, on all exposed surface, it is probably that it is preserved to its actual height in antiquity.

N.B: Due to this mortar the extent drawings of the feature are not reliable with regard to brick structure of the wall and most reliable document for the regular structure of the wall is photo's 20020616_jpq_025/036 taken of the western fringe of the wall left standing while removing the wall.
Wall 1000 is probably similar to wall 635, given their location, height, etc. Wall 635 has lime plaster, and 1000 has not, but could relate to the use of space of the different parts of the house rather than an indicator of distinction between the wall per se.

Damage to the western central part of the platform may be attributed to the removal of a decorative feature which is clearly the case on F.2370.

To account for the different lengths of the wall – one extending across the length of the trench and the other only extending 1.0m from the northern L.O.E I ‘created’ a second construction cut, (15449), with the assumption that this cut/truncated the lower wall for the construction of the upper.

This deposit was sealed by a 0.1m thick dump of dark grey loose ashy silt (14460), which formed the core of the platform. This deposit was the same as unit (7957), excavated during the 2004 season, from which a number of animal figurines were recovered. Unit (14460) contained a range of artefacts, including a variety of animal bone, worked and unworked stone, worked bone points, obsidian blades and blanks, and a broken antler tool.

This type of soil gave way to a more brown silty clay layer first reached in the SW part and farther down in the NE part, creating a sloping base for the first infill.

After the first infill unit 20144 was excavated, a second infill unit 20170 was uncovered, which has less of the grey ashy soil and more firm brown earth with mud brick rubble mixed in. The unit ended with the revealing of a more homogeneous brown layer below. At this level, the cut is no longer truncated to the east by feature 3918 and is a roughly complete circle.

The function of the wall is not apparent. It could be a shoring wall for F. 636, but it could also be a wall of a shed or other flimsy construction erected in the courtyard/open space (space 85).

SM notes in 2003:
As we removed few top rubbley layers we hit regular square bricks grey and brown in colour - not having construction of a proper wall, rather a construction for some other purpose: either a shoring wall as already stated or stairs-like feature that is definitely abutting west wall of space 201. Terms we used to describe material for units #8601 and #8602 were only conditional, since there were no layers of bricks, or more likely, all handy materials were used. Plaster (unit #8605) we found only in traces, not sure about the outer look of the wall F. 1001.
The mortar is brown and greasy, thick uop to 7 cm. Bricks are orange and grey in colour, not laid in any order. Section drawn on the sheet shows exactly the way wall looked like three brick courses above the bottom grey course.
Bottom grey brick dimensions are: 66x22x5-7 cm, taken separately as sample 5 of unit #8601. Bottom grey course of bricks sits directly on midden. 
This wall presumably served to strengthen wall F. 636 and it appears these two were laid contemporaneously as it laid on same midden material as wall F. 636.
Wall is aligned north-south, parallel to the west wall of space 201; made up of bricks #8601 and mortar #8602. 6 courses of bricks survived at the highest (southern) bit of our wall (around 60 cm)."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Mudbrick wall forming southern extent of building 75. Defined in  2007, and excavated  in 2008. Upon excavation, the relationship of the wall to 5005 became clear and is defined as follows (from Archive report 2008):

The walls for the space 328 (F.2624 and F.5005, the southwestern and southeastern walls respectively), were founded inside this cut before the cut was finally backfilled with two fills. The first of these, (17301) in the southeastern return and then by (17088) in the southwestern return. The walls themselves were bonded into one another, making them a single construction event.

The brick elements (15776) (in wall F2624) and (17314) (in wall F.5005) were all comprised of firm cemented slightly silty sand, which was pale yellow-brown in colour. The bricks were bonded with cemented pale grey-brown slightly ashy silt, which contained occasional to moderate charcoal flecks, which averaged between 50 and 70mm thick. 

The walls stood to an average height of 0.4m high from the base of the cut to their final surviving height. This amounted to between 3 and 4 courses (stepping down towards the southern end of the space probably to account for the underlying slope). After the backfilling of the construction cut only 0.2m of the wall stood higher than the internal ground level of the building. The backfill of the construction cuts for these walls, (17088) and (17301), were both mid-grey brown sandy silts, containing brick fragments. The uppermost of these, in the cut for the southern wall, (17088), not only filled the construction cut (17318), but also served to level the southern portion of the room, forming the foundation for the primary oven structure which abutted the south wall of Space 328.."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "when the east face of the west wall of space 89 was exposed (by scraping) it was realise that this construction between spaces 88 and 89 has at least two building phases - one which comprises light brown to beige bricks, and mortar almost similar in colour, but midden-like (grey in the south part); it's the later wall actually belonging to space 89. The other phase of the wall, earlier one, consists of orangish/red bricks, and extremely strong, lumpy mortar of a yellowish/white colour. Once the east wall of space 88 and packing/fill inbetween this and west wall of space 89 were removed, it was definitely clear that feature 1017 should be assigned only to upper, later part of this wall. That part consists of 5 rows of bricks, made of silty sandy clay, same as bricks of the later walls of bldg. 3 and space 89. Mortar is made of midden-like material with bits of charred wood, animal bones, obsidian chips included; it's sticky and firm, especially in the south end where the soil is always wet. 
Rows of bricks and mortar are sloping southwards and layers of mortar are thicker in the south. In the northern portion of the west face of this wall  a patch of white plaster was attached to this wall. 

Average dimensions of bricks are: 0.85x0.35x0.07 m. 
Mortar: 2.16x0.35x0.03-0.05 m. 
Munsell chart for bricks: 7.5 YR 7/3, 10 YR 8/3; mortar 10 YR 7/2, 10 YR 6/2.

F. 1017 is most probably built at the same time as F. 761 (south wall of space 89) since, during excavation of this wall, it was discovered that  the bricks of the two are interlocked. F. 761 is contemporary to F. 1016 (east wall of space 89) and hence these three walls make one unique structure.

  c:dimensions "H=0.91 m; L=1.56 m; W=around 0.30 m"^^xsd:string ;
  c:description "South wall of space 88 is constructed of regular rows of brick and layers of mortar. There are 10 rows of brick preserved; bricks are made of reddish light brown sandy stuffed clay and they are of a standardized thickness (4-8cm) and shape (regular, elongated up to 0.85m). Mortar is of that sticky middenny type that was used for all the other walls of the space. But here it is moist and greasy as is the whole wall. It contains inclusions such as charcoal, slats, gypsum.
This wall is contemporary with the east wall (f 163) since the bricks of the two interlace. It is probably contemporary with the west wall (f 1020). Directly below this wall lies the earlier one whose remains are visible at the bottom of sp. 88 (unit 8643) as well as underneath the east wall of space. This older wall is made of blackish bricks of a very different texture comparing to those of the later wall - they are stronger, moist and more compact - which makes it easy to define the bottom end of the south wall os space 88.
It would be interesting to notice that the lower part of this wall is wetter and accordingly darker, with the colours more emphasized than in its upper part. Munsell colour chart for the upper portion of wall would be 7.5 yr / 6/4 for the bricks, and 10 yr 4/2 for the mortar. After removal of the south wall of space 88 it was revealed it actually continues to the west, enclosing the space 87 (which was assigned F 1024 before the situation was encountered). It is very likely that the excavation of this south wall of spaces 88 and 87 (f 1019 and f1024) will be coni=tinued next year.
When we excavated 8685 (fill inbetween f 1019 and f 1022) a new surface was exposed revealing strange situation where in the upper part some five rows of brick of orangeyish brown colour are regularly placed, belonging to f 1022 while underneath there is a layered midden with 3 randomly placed orange bricks, one above the other, that are not part of any visible feature. Next to them, to the east, a block of 6 black bricks and similar mortar sits on top of brown sandy brick, with thin layer of midden like mortar inbtw.

This post emplacement appears to have been in use throughout the house sequence and through all the remodelling of the associated features at its base.

At the earliest phase it was associated with a bench F.1653. The mortar packing around the post (17927) was similar to the bench rendering (17901) and both successively plastered throughout use.

The bench then went through various incarnations (see above) but the post remained extant.

Prior to construction of bench F.1653 there was a post (see cut (17924) and fills) in the same location which appears to have been a construction event. SF 12/07/09"^^xsd:string ;

All that can be said is that this wall is later B42 as it was built on midden that abuts / overlies F826. Similarity of brick but not mortar may suggest some of bricks from B42 reused in this structure? Also Presences of plaster-- so reuse. 

Not assigned space number or building number as very little to say about them.

  c:description "Twelve courses of mudbrick, orientated N/S. Heavily eroded to North. Slopes slightly to south. Wall is in foundation trench [11345], which appears initially to have had a plank place along its base (11363). The wall was then constructed and the trench backfilled with a mixture of midden material and mortar/ mudbrick mix. Trench is cut into midden (11347) below and also cuts posthole [11373], which may have been a marker for location of wall. See F1522. Mudbrick used forwall is large. Aprox 88 x 35 x 9 cm. Another mudbrick feature F1521 was constructed at the same time, possibly to strengthen NE corner of B42. Mortar used (11354) appears uniform throughout bricks and mortar are well bonded together and wall appears to be of good construction. 

Unfortunately this wall has no relationship to any other walls of thi building except possibly to south, which was excavated in 2002. The North wall has been truncated by Mellaart and eroded.

So we have the eastern wall of B42, it is well made and well thought out. It is assumed the others would be equally well made. The most interesting thing about F826 is the construction method. It is built onto midden, which was probably subsiding as evidenced by later build up on the platforms (see 1501-2). So a foundation trench and plank was used to provide a level and stable base on which to build. Suggesting a knowledge and sophistication of construction methods and adapting them to particular situations.

From Archive Report 2005:

Prior to the deposition of the levelling deposits, some major consolidation preparations had to be undertaken, as represented by mud-brick and mortar foundations. It was at this point in the excavation that only became clear that some of the walls of lower Building 56 had been reused within Building 44, with some strengthened by internal foundation supports. This consolidation work may have been deemed necessary prior to the construction of the superstructure of Building 44 as Building 56 appeared to have suffered from severe weakness at its southern end, as evidenced by slumping of the floors and features. What appears to have happened, and this will need confirmation by excavation, is that the southern and eastern walls of Building 56 had collapsed or been demolished and replaced by foundations F.2053 and F.2054. In addition to this the south west corner of the building was strengthened by foundation wall F.1345, while the west wall of Building 56, F.104, is supported by the addition of foundation wall F.2062. Thus part of wall F.104 from Building 56 is re-used within Building 44, along with walls F.1323, F.1342 and F.1339, with new walls constructed at the south and east, F.1340 and F.1341, these built on the new foundations."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Reinforcing wall foundation for east wall and south wall of building 44 only partially removed in 2005. 
South wall foundation construction for building 44. 

From Archive Report 2005:

Prior to the deposition of the levelling deposits, some major consolidation preparations had to be undertaken, as represented by mud-brick and mortar foundations. It was at this point in the excavation that only became clear that some of the walls of lower Building 56 had been reused within Building 44, with some strengthened by internal foundation supports. This consolidation work may have been deemed necessary prior to the construction of the superstructure of Building 44 as Building 56 appeared to have suffered from severe weakness at its southern end, as evidenced by slumping of the floors and features. What appears to have happened, and this will need confirmation by excavation, is that the southern and eastern walls of Building 56 had collapsed or been demolished and replaced by foundations F.2053 and F.2054. In addition to this the south west corner of the building was strengthened by foundation wall F.1345, while the west wall of Building 56, F.104, is supported by the addition of foundation wall F.2062. Thus part of wall F.104 from Building 56 is re-used within Building 44, along with walls F.1323, F.1342 and F.1339, with new walls constructed at the south and east, F.1340 and F.1341, these built on the new foundations."^^xsd:string ;

Most striking thing about this pit is that the upper fill is truncated/ contains two infant burials, F1536 and F1540, otherwise this pit is fairly nondescript and function unclear.

Discussion
The deposition/ burial of two infants within the limits of this pit suggest it was known about and probably the digging and filling of this pit occurred only a short time before the burials, which appear contemporary.
Was this pit just a convenient location for the burials or was it in fact dug specially and the burials placed in it and their separate cuts not exist?
The other infant burials in this space, F1530 and F1541, suggest an opportunistic use of recently dug pits/ change in use of the space and so these burials appear to fit with that, or maybe even determine these actions?"^^xsd:string ;

 The best defined pit in Sp272 by a long way, in contrast to the others which are much more diffuse.

The height of these pedestals are from the platform top. The horns are placed inward and enclose the platform. 

In a couple of places in the two pedestals there appears to be slight gap or recess - this may well have been produced when the horn sheth decayed, but it is by no means conclusive. If the sheath was present, the horn would have been a third as long (reducing greatly the available space in the platform. 

The top of the platform has abandonment clustes on it. A stone cluster (17512) and two carbonized basket impressions or some form of matting (17528). The platform has also suffered some subsidense in the west breaking the floors, this is most likely due to burial movement/voids below the platform. There also appears to eb some disturbance in the NE corner (possibly baby burial).

But it does not have any preserved supports etc as F3650. But as so little remains of this one, it is not sure.
At the bottom of the bin, in the NE corner, a charred pointed wooden tool was found, on the floor, aligned with the E wall of the bin. It was pointed and was made of pistachio wood according to bot specialists. See photos.

The wall was heavily truncated and disturbed by roots and animals and very little can be said about it’s original form and composition. It seems to be a half-brick-thick wall that is made up of light brown and light-orange mud-brick and mid grey mortar.

It was located north of feature 3688 (which is in the middle of B.102, dividing spaces 17 and 18) approximately 10 cm, and it went into the northen trench wall. Therefore its extent remains unknown.

This is basically a large cut feature, and was assigned a feature number mainly because, even though only one fill, it was quite large, counting that it also went into the trench wall. It contained one fill, consisting of a clayey compound of clay, ash and many charcoal lenses. In this sense the fill was quite homogenous. Findwise, (some) animal bones were found as well as a few obsidian pieces.

Since it was located under room fill (although visible with still some room fill left in S18) it was dug down in the floor. It was quickly filled (one event). Functionally it is hard to say what the pit was made for, since it goes into trench wall and we can't see the full extent."^^xsd:string ;

Otherwise this was mostly disturbed and hard to recognize, because of it being truncated in 2012. In the E trench section it is visible that it was built in respect to oven F.7101, that is, built around it. It is probable they were used contemporary, but also more certainly the platform is younger. 

This feature was cut by the construction of a hearth (F3692), the latest hearth in this space. This is not a random decision; the removing of the platform showed that it was built on top of two other hearths; one in the same place (below) F7135 (the youngest) and one next to it, in to the trench wall. In fact, the make up u20979, which was cut together with the plaster of the platform to make hearth F3692, was built in respect to F7124 (the hearth next to this make up, beneath the plaster u20949). Perhaps it should be seen as this hearth and the platform was built contemporarily, even though the platform came first.

It is perhaps so that the reason for the platform to be built was to organize and structure further the order and activity of fire installations. The rectangular hearth was the centre perhaps for this planning, and meant to be in the middle of the space surrounded by plaster (i.e. the platform)."^^xsd:string ;

A post retrieval scar is visible in the S wall, together with numerous micro-layers of ashes and charcoal of ca. 25cm depth in total that seem to have been re-deposited after the pit was infilled. 
The W side of the feature is ill-defined due to the difficulty entailed in distinguishing between the silty clay sediments that compose the pit infill (U.20696) and the clayish sediments of the S wall undercut (U.20912). 
The bottom of the pit sloped towards the SW and has been heavily affected by bioturbation (animal burrowing). Several oven fragments (burnt clay) were encountered towards the bottom. 
Two large natural rocks were found within the infill, maybe part of the original post feature, aimed at giving more stability to the post and to hold it vertically.

Red plastered platform first found in 2006

It is the earliest feature of this location. The red plastered platform lies directly on the floor of Sp.284. Then it turned out to be a hearth 2305 with its floor twice renewed.
During the late floor level of the space it was plastered all over, on top and used as a platform again.

One can think that the red plastered walls of this feature might belong to the hearth 2305. However the traces of red paint and the curves on the kerbs indicates that the top of the feature was once plastered with the need of a hearth. The top layer was destroyed but the wals were kept as red plastered. 

No trace of burning on the red plastered walls make us think that the fire in the hearth was not heavy. 

It can be called as a fire spot, however the floor and the settings with pebble layers imply more a hearth."^^xsd:string ;

This raises two problems: 
- This platform shows very clear evidence of bruning. Its SW part has been very affected by fire (Black and soft plaster). Yet, only B52 has burned. (B51 was constructed inside B52, in an area cleard of burning residues.)
- But, in plans and synthesis of B52, this platform is still called PLT 1574 (B51's number...). 
So: This platform we started excavating: should it be associated with B51? In this case, burning evidence on its top does not make sense. Or, should it be associated with B52? In this case, should we change its feature number, and the platform must have been excavated until the top of B52's remains of burnt plaster in previous excavation seasons?
Despite that it has been said in reports that Sp.94 in B52 was never really excavated (only the floor was reached) it has been possible to realize that parts of the platform were removed anyway (by compairing pictures of hte excavation of B51 and B52 \"excavated\").
Thus: The layer u10319 (white and not affected by fire) corresponds to the reconstruction of the platform when B51 was build after B52's burning. It thus corresponds to PLT 1574.
But: the first layer excavated this year: u.20614, just under u.10318, corresponds to the remains (after 7 years of erosion) of burnt plaster laying on the top of the B52's platform. This platform should be called differently (PLT F. 3694) (being part of another building)."^^xsd:string ;

Unexcavated in 2004

From Archive Report 2006:

A central platform F.1656 consisted of a primary make up layer of mid brown silty  clay (13632). This was sealed by a series of thin truncated floors (13658), which only  survived at the S edge of the platform, the rest of the floors being worn away while  the building was in use. These were sealed in turn by floors (13604) and (12699). A  cluster of obsidian flakes lying on the later ‘dirty’ floor (12699) was recorded as 
(13000). The tool being manufactured was not established but it is easy to imagine  someone sitting on the platform directly to the south whilst working the obsidian. In  the SE corner of platform F.1656 a small ashy deposit (13698) is contemporary with  the knapping activity and contained semi-articulated fish bones. It is likely these  represent food waste and may have been deliberately swept into the corner of the  platform. This activity area was sealed by a white plaster floor (12693), which was in turn sealed by the heavily truncated remains of a series of at least five floors; recorded  as (12692) this season and (7944) in the 2004 season. This final deposit survived only  in a small area to the W of the platform and may represent deliberate scouring of the platform as part of the process of closing the building."^^xsd:string ;

Unexcavated in 2004.

Interpretation so far: bench or raised platform, truncated on west side. Layers of plaster visible on the feature indicate several phases, the first of which is smaller and further south. This phase is built up against the plaster of the south wall (F 1660). Later the feature was extended northwards, and a lip built up against the east wall (see sketch; photo).
Unclear relationship with floor 1663 - due to unfinished excavation.

Further interpretation warrants further excavation.

The interperetation now of all this units is that the western row of bricks are part of a wall , while the rest of them are just making a sort of a raised platform. 

I dont know about platform (it is very likely that thats the correct  interperation) but I'm convinced that the western row of bricks is a wall . , because just that continues towards south (wall 10232) on the other side of the grave cut. 10226. Wall 10232 is very wall like , as well as the western row of this feature. This means that while the other bricks of this feature have different alignements on different courses , the western row is consistent and very solid. 

10231 the second course of bricks has a different layout than the one below (excent for the wall bit) and it leaves an area with no bricks in the middle (10229)

10220 the upper most course of bricks has an area with no bricks in the middle , but on adifferent layout than 10229. This upper one is called 10228.

We know for sure that 10220 brick layout. Is actually an other face of the building since floors in space 237 come against bricks 10231 and 10253, but bricks 10220 cover partly the floors.

Moreover the feature contained substantial amount of pottery sherds, which may indicate a storage function of this pit. However, the exact purpose of the pit is unclear. The feature (pit infill U. 30721) was recognized by the differing color and more loose consistency of soil from the surrounding orange and quite compact soil.

  c:description "This is the area excavated by the BACH team in 2002. Although at least two plaster floors were excavated in this feature (burial platform) as described in the BACH report, the feature sheet was completely void as of August 2013. The same situation applies to the units of floors and make-up mentioned in the report. Therefore, I cannot be sure about what was lying on top of this feature before my arrival this season. 

I started works in this eastern part of Space 87 by removing the eroded make-up units 30596 and 30109 in the N end of this area. The fragments of plaster that I found seemed to indicate that this NE corner was plastered, probably constituting an extension to the N or a levelling episode of platform F.638. 

I then removed U.30114, white plaster floors. The thickness of this unit varies from 1cm to the north to 6cm in the SE corner of the building, indicating multiple layers of re-plastering. Very small fragments of red paint were found in the E and W edges of the feature, evidence of at least one plastering event involving painting. 

Under this layer lies U.30140, an heterogeneous infill patch that is on top of another plaster unit (ca.1-2cm depth), 30172. This patchy infill could be thus interpreted as an attempt to raise the height of the platform, which was sinking in the center due to the burial cuts.

Under this second layer of plaster lies U.30178, to be excavated next season. Clearly identifiable in the burial cut, this unit is a clayish deposit that constitutes the base for the platform, going deep into the stratigraphic sequence.

This platform feature, on top of which sits lip F.7303, seems to be earlier than the adjacent platform F.7114 to the west."^^xsd:string ;

There were no traces of fire, though, on the neighbouring plaster 31244 and the wall of the installation 31242. The fill 31241 on the other hand seems to fit into the picture. My idea is that if the rather brittle wall would have been built directly on 31240, the big changes in temperature might have caused it to crumble apart. The fill could have functioned as a protection against this fate, despite its small depth. The lack of charcoal throughout the feature could mean that the installation was cleaned before abandonment.
If this is the case, though, I cannot give an explanation of why the clay was left in place."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "1995:
The FI is a roughly irregularly (almost sub-triangular) shaped  feature in the SW corner of room 70. It may not be an original feature of the room since the wall faces behind it are at least partially plastered. it is at a (currently) .. . .height above the floor. the flue or door if the FI is to the east.

The FI was excavated in quadrant and both N-S and E-W section were drawn. The layers filling the latest Phase of the feature are clear.
(1). On the floor of the FI (currently unnumbered) was a thin ashy layer.  In places the lower part of this wax more compact and seemed like a subsequent  surface thought may likely represent the burning of the interface between the tow layers. A thin, discontinuous spread of white plaster lay above this ashy layer
(2) this was in turn covered by a C. 5 cm  thick deposit of mixed plaster and clay rubble./ This layer was found across the surface of the FI except against its southern edge where the lower ashy layer merger wit the upper one.
(3) this latter was similar in thickness and make-up to the lower one and represents a second phase of use within the FI. No plaster was apparent, but in the NW quadrant I attempted to separate the more compact fill (1155)  - which may be the burnt top of the rubble below - from the ashier upper fill (1153) within this layer.
(4) Finally the FI was filled up with  another rubbly layer containing bits of brunt brick and plaster to the N this may lip over the top of the surviving plastered face of the FI.

Less clear was the definition of the walls. It appeared in most parts of the feature except the NE that the fill layers stood up against a compact, mixed packing fill a few cm thick, and only scantily plastered. Against the south wall this appeared very mixed with chunks of daub and plaster but not layered. Against the western half these appeared to have 3 layers, however - 2 of mixed fill separated by a thin dark grey layer. These were removed as one (1132) and (1160) back to a better plaster face, almost continuous n the S wall and less well preserved on the N face where a black band also appears to run back into the structure of the FI. In the western face of the SW quadrant chunks of daub poke through the plastered face. In the same face of the NW quadrant a darker band of soil runs between the lower plastered face and an upper band of plaster tilting into the FI at about 30 degrees.

Where the FI wall leaves the line of the house wall and turns east the interaction is more confusing. A compact packing fill apparently inside the line of [1131] was removed as (1154) but no plastered face was apparent. Instead it stood against further compacted fill with small fragments of plaster above a layer of orange mud-brick (?) in turn above a dark ashy layer. These strata ran off to the  N and may be linked wit the so-called 'rake-out' in that area. The ash may also run below the surface of the FI and this might define an earlier phase of its use. In general the compacted clay surface of the base o the I appears to peel away from the plastered wall which continues to go down, and indicates earlier phase of this feature.

On the NE face towards the opening of the FI the plastered face is again found but does not appear to extend down below this latest surface.

The nature of the facing is indicative of damage / disturbance which has caused the loss of some of the  plaster and the apparent slumping forward of plaster in  some areas (though this may reflect the shape of the dome of the FI); and /or of a piecemeal approach to facing and replastering the feature, seen especially in the extra layers f packing fill noticed in the SW and NW corners of the FI.

Description continued 1997 GML:
Sub-circular oven with high standing walls - no roof survived but almost certainly existed. The opening was on the eastern side but this changed orientation slightly in the later phase of remodelling. The later phase was mainly excavated in '95 and showed three reflooring episodes each associated with an ashy layer (possibly even four). These were preceded by an earlier phase with only one major flooring episode, over which lay some of the superstructure, levelled off in preparation for the later rebuild, and with stones packed into the opening to seal it off. These and some of the floors associated with the secondary construction were excavated in '96.

Discussion:
Sketch includes matrix.

GML 1997:

Several things to note about the long history of this oven - the repetition of re-flooring, always associated with an ash layer which might be the remnants of the last hearth except that it always seems to lie _under_ the floor, and in places where no floor lies underneath it. (e.g. 1186 - 1253 - 1254). It would not take much effort to remove it prior to re-flooring and perhaps then the ashy layer in a deliberate layer placed before re-flooring - acting as some 'cleaning' deposit such as an ashy layer directly underlies the primary floors of Building 1. The other thing is the re-orientation of the opening in the oven - in the primary phase it aligns to the blocked opening in wall F3 and may therefore not been visible in Space 71; similarly the re-orientation moves northward, facing more into space 70 when the access is now more blocked on the northern side (see sketch plan). It is interesting that almost all the re-floorings are associated with the oven rebuild which itself probably had two phases - a primary rebuild _on top_ of the original, and a secondary rebuild / relining of the interior. The whole secondary construction appears to be contemporary with current phase III, and was probably as external oven / outside the building. The primary phase itself is not an original construction of the building but a later addition.

2000 In Post-excavation in 2000 it was decided to sub-divide F11. The latest phase remains F11 but the two earlier phases are now F359 and F360"^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "This feature was initially identified as F.3621 which was wrong so the oven got a new feature number instead (F.7108). The top part of the oven was partially excavated previous seasons and was initially interpreted as a niche, probably because of the large chunks of plaster layers that was situated in the infill of the oven. The section through the oven, which was formed during previous seasons, was kept during excavation in order to prevent the oven from collapsing. This implies that just slightly more than half of the oven was excavated. Another source critical matter is that an animal burrow was situated in the western part of the oven, running from top to bottom (at the very edge of the oven). 
The oven has a domed superstructure and it was situated in the dirty area in space 336. It was built into wall F.3096 and precedes a later oven, which makes it the earliest oven in building 77. The clay dome is preserved with its roof intact and it stretches about 0,8 m into the wall. The back of the dome can be seen from the other side of the wall (in space 488). The oven had four series of oven floors and after its use life it was infilled and blocked with different kind of materials and another oven was built in front of it.
The oven was either cut into the wall or possibly built at the same time as the house (the clay dome is not yet excavated). The wall (U.20496) from an older building (made of mud brick and mortar) and old infill (U.20483) was used together with a make-up/levelling layer (U.20478) as an oven base. The dome was constructed of clay layers with more than one application (there were plaster remains inside) and it abuts the first oven floor. All oven floors were sloping. This was made on purpose and was not a result of later subsidence, but for what reason is an open question. The first oven floor (U.20473) was badly preserved and fragmented, part of it was probably raked out and a levelling layer (U.20477) was put into the oven in order to build a new oven floor (U.20469). The succeeding three oven floors (U.20469, U.20466, U.20464) were better preserved, especially the last oven floor was in good condition and it did not look scorched. Maybe the abandonment of the oven was not due to the need for a new floor (which perhaps would have made the oven to narrow), but rather for another reason, maybe a threatening collapse or because the last floor actually did make the oven to narrow or perhaps for reasons which is not so practically founded. 
The oven was infilled and blocked in an interesting way. The varied material that was used for the blocking infill seems to represent the building material of a house. First a large chunk of floor plaster with make-up layers was put on top of the last oven floor, right in the back of the oven. Then a clayish material mixed with charcoal, a burnt piece of mud brick and about three chunks of plaster layers were put into the oven together with pieces of oven wall (perhaps originating from a destroyed part of the oven). 
The function of the different blocking materials that were applied to the oven after that the dome was filled is unclear. Like the infill of the oven, they were of different materials, compact clay, soft and friable clay and mud brick made of mica-based clay. Initially the mud brick blocking was thought to be part of a later oven but the material/texture of the blocking makes this less probable and it may as well have been made to harmonize with the surrounding wall."^^xsd:string ;

The oven had two distinct surfaces inside (baked hard) (u.30632) & (u.30633), and was finally filled by generic room fill, although inside the oven structure there were burnt clay fragments, which were probably  collapsed oven superstructure. The oven walls were lined inside w. plaster on its north side. The oven was associated with a sequence of dirty floors. On its eastern external face was a white plaster, and this was abbutted by an adjacent platform F.7203)."^^xsd:string ;

F.533 was a slightly truncated oven feature to the west of the south eastern quadrant of building 23.

It sloped towards its centre and from west to east. The lack of a baked surface at the centre suggests that this may have been removed.

  c:description "Oven cut (4341) into east face of wall 401 - just above lowest course of bricks. The oven comprises of several layers, a hard crusty + cracked layer on the top (4366), an underlying dark brown loose burnt layer (4362) and then a grey/light brown soft silty layer with some hard patches (4663). The base of the oven (ie the bricks underneath the layers) were red + scorched. The surrounding bricks in the side of the cut were also orangey/red lower down.
The oven had been plastered over ( possibly at floor levels - need to check plans) and the sides of the cut were also plastered [4361]. On top of this plaster layer was a layer of white silty/plastery infill.

The oven 443 was disovered during excavation of the adjacent infill [4340] with a mattock. While it is possible that part of the oven was removed accidently during excavation, it is also likely that half (eastern half) of th oven was removed in antiquity. Fill 4340 was found above, to the east and to the east below the level of the oven. That the oven and cut were plastered over suggests that the cut for the oven had been reused as a small niche and therefore part of oven 443 had been a continuation of the floor (possibly level VI). then this floor layer should also have been recovered in the area where infill 4340 was dug.
April 2000
The oven would have been a Level VII feature in space 180, building 24 (Mellaarts Shrine 10 level VII). From the sequence excavated it appears to be an early phase feature in the building which was then plastered over and possibly used as a niche and then 'closed' by [4361] and hence not recorded by Mellaart on his plan of level VII (sf)."^^xsd:string ;

Phase I (earliest) consisted of a foundation/levelling deposit [5197], against which were teo separate 'lips' [5190] + [5195] (ie bits out the front!). On top of the foundation sat an oven structure [5196], which had been heavily truncated. There was no associated oven base. But the foundationd deposit was scorched so maybe the base had been truncated away.
Phase II - consisted of a good oven base [5188], which wasn't hard but heavily scorched. This overlay the 'lips' mentioned above. On top of this was the main oven superstructure [5160]. Possibly within this but more likely related to phase III was a very nice hard oven floor [5159] (left in on th north 1/2, truncated out on the south 1/2).
Phase III (latest) - an extra oven superstructure arm was added on the southern half [5158] (maybe the earlier one collapsed?). This was supported by a splodge of white plaster [5157]. It also seems that they added some odd bits of oven floor [5148/9] on the northern side (one with a bit of red ochre on it) as well as a new bit of arm. Its possible that these alterations were to do with a shift in the orientation of the NW (Phase I+II) to west (Phase III). It's also interesting to note that the shift ro Phase III was also accompanied by a big deposit across the north and west of the room [5184].
Finally, the oven was smashed up, infilled with oven debris [5076] and the platform F.553 built over it.

The floors associated with it to the south and east show no evidence of formal surfacing, although the uppermost floor was scattered with bits of stone and burnt bone. It is also interesting that after the use of this oven the area was covered in a thick layer of floor packing [5194] and then a sequence of dirty floors with no associated oven, at least in the south-east corner of the building. It may be that the floors in this area became so compacted beneath the level of the underlying wall, during the use of this oven that it was considered necessary to build-up the area with packing and floors, before it could be used as a working area with hearths once again, as took place in the later phases of the building."^^xsd:string ;

Beneath it, forming a shallow scoop fill of darker burnt soil, of quite soft and silty texture was dug as unit #6368. In northern part of this unit hearth floor appeared, probably representing another, older fire installation following dark lain, apparent to the N-W of F. 630 and of F. 632. 
Phasing: feature was cut by F. 604, thus pre-dating F. 604, and it appears that unit #6266 was beneath the floor level #6276 which then probably post-dates F. 630, and gives the phase of when exactly in biography of platform F. 169 this hearth was installed and used.

  c:description "Second red fire installation in F. 775.
The floor of this fire installation (most probably oven) lies directly beneath the floor of the \"the first red fire installation\" - F. 777. It was surrounded by sequence of floors and packings which were connected with previously excavated fire installations in this area (check matrix for F. 775).
After removing the floor visible after removing F. 777, it became obvious that this oven had more than one phase of usage. First floor was made of baked reddish brown clay (builiding material with flat surface), with base of completely loose sandy reddish soil right above second floor. While the first floor was excavated, the relationship between the oven phases and floors in F. 775 and rest of the kitchen was established. It seems that floor #1 of the oven corresponds with the floor #10 (unit 8378) or #11 (unit 8449), and floor #2 with earlier floors in the kitchen. During excavation of the rim it was discovered that it is sitting on floor #12 in the kitchen, at least its first phase. What is interesting is that north of F. 778 more floor layers were encountered than in the south, which may suggest that They were trying to solve the problem of sloping of the kitchen surface towards north by putting extra floors and packings in this zone. Also a make-up material that was found in the north portion of kitchen can indicate the same idea. 
Second floor of the oven is orange/red and circular in shape, while the first floor and rim were rectangular. It consisted of pieces of scorched clay mixed with sandy red clay, so it looked more like a substructure (foundation) for the oven (but still, it could be a floor destroyed when the new one was placed there). It was removed together with underlying layer of burnt clay, dark brown in colour, with sort of grainy structure (reticulate) which stretches underneath the second rim, too. This rim was made of white plaster and is actually a continuation of surrounding floor in the kitchen (#13), but curving above the oven edge. While removing this floor #13/rim #2 and the oven base, it was revealed that the oven was sitting directly on the midden and that floors #14 and 15 were connected with its base. This may mean that this oven was built in the 1st phase of building 3, that is, it was one of the earliest feature in the house.
A small shallow depression in the midden surface is visible in the place where the oven once was."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Bench feature within Building 42, part of well furnished space in direct relation to platforms F1501 and F1502 to the north. This bench feature actually predates the platforms and all other features within the building, and therefore represents the first feature to be constructed.
Excavation of the bench has allowed a rare opportunity, thanks to its quality of both preservation and construction, to view, layer by layer, the process involveed in creating this feature.
Once (11328), the make up layer laid down onto the midden surface prior to construction, the bench was the first feature to be tentatively laid out with mudbrick bricks (11335) and (11334), the initial shape and form of the bench beginning to form. (Despite the pre-construction burials F1517 and F1516 obviously indicating and pre-empting the platform construction, it is thought that it was actually the bench that was the first feature to be started). This early phase is likely to be fairly contemporary with mudbricks (11329) (11323) (11322) and (11321) F1519, but definitely came before these in a strategraphic sense.
Mudbricks (11309) were then added to the bench - a very similar brick type to (11334) below. Some evidence of plastering was noted between 2 bricks on the inside of the feature, suggesting that those bricks were actually reused from another/earlier building.
A thick make-up/packing material was then applied, strangely not covering the whole of the previous bricks, The deposit, a light greyish brown clayey silt was very similar to those seen higher in the sequence, suggesting continuity and same construction phase. Upon this 3 large mudbricks, yet again a different type were laid. In plan, these were slightly askew from those below. Its quite nice to see this mish mash of bricks and slightly poor construction which provides a much more human insight into how these buildings were constructed. Similarly, none of the bricks mentioned above actually reach the wall. F826 that would have been in place prior to bench construction. Throughout its sequence, various episodes of packing were used  to basically plug the gaps. So whether not enough bricks were available to the constructors, or whether it was purely a mistake, actions were taken to put things right.
After one such make up phase between wall and brick, another single course of brick was added to the eastern end only, in order to raise the bench in this place. Again it it likey that this brick was reused as some plaster remains on the top. This plase may well have been higher at some point. There is evidence that the bench was raised at the eastern end far higher that the rest of the bench. This is seen on the upstanding wall F826 and from its plastered surface (11314). Directly above the bench, no plaster remains for the entire height of the wall.
The bench, now with its shape and form present, was then covered with a light greyish brown silt packing/make up/bonding material (10493) (10492) and (10487). All deficiencies and previous construction problems were covered at this point, and a solid and square bench shape was created. The two platforms to the north F1501 and F1502 must have also been satisfactorally completed at this time, as the same packing material covered every constructional feature within the building, bringing everything into phase. All features were then plastered, again in a continuous single act to form a beautifully made surfaced living space.
Two later phases of construction of the bench can be noted by the addition of two plaster surfaces. (10481), the penultimate phase of plaster sits directly beneath (10409), a very similar deposit. Both were laid onto the bench (only on the top) to represent a new phase in order to heighten the feature, presumably as the platforms as the platforms also rose. Both layers were approx 0.05m thick in places with the plaster lifting off in flat bottomed chunks to reveal the earlier surfaces below. This indicates that they were indeed 3 phases only?
When first excavated, the eastern end was visibly different from the rest of the bench, as indicated by the lack of plaster. Together with the rest of the bench, as indicated by the lack of plaster. Together with the evidence seen in the lack of plster (11314) on wall F826 directly above the bench, we can assume that an additional feature existed here at some point, and for whatever reason (ritual destruction at end of house use?) was damaged to the point of destruction.
A possible suggestion remains in the form of plaster debris (10406) scattered across platform F1502, first seen after the removal of room fill (10404). Initially thought to relate to 'niches' F1508 and 1509, the debris all appear to be plastered mudbrick fragments with plaster on more than one side, I.e around corners etc. and differ from (10405) which are pretty much non-specific plaster debris. Once lifted, it was thought that they probably actually relate to the bench and its desrtuction/dismantleing phase. One piece in particular appeared to fit very well on one corner. There is, however, no indication as to the height of this bench feature, save for the lack of lack of plaster on wall F826. With this in mind we can suggest that it was higher than the fragment of wall that remains today."^^xsd:string ;

These deposits (the uppermost unit has the number 8026) abutt an earlier phase of bench (1304) and would seem to have been overcut (most probably by the Greek team in 1996-1997).  Just south of these deposits there is a similar range of deposits (again cut) forming part of platform 1306.  Deposits 8026 (plus those underneath) would therefore seem to NOT form part of bench 1301 but abutt bench 1304.

From Archive Report 2006:
The sequence of construction of the bench was relatively straightforward with a single thick white plaster coating, (12822), lain over a make-up layer that was shared with platform F.2057 to the north, 12874. The sequence of plaster and make-up would appear to predate the plaster coatings on platform F.2055 to the south and F.2057 to the north suggesting the bench was the primary installation, within the central east
suite of features. The bench was also coated with a distinct white plaster, as were platforms F.2057, F.2058 and F.2059.

Filled by Dumping layers and burnt stones.

Clay Bin. Square in shape. Situated over oven 208 and probably built at same time as corner bin 257 to the East. Not yet excavated (25-9-97)

excavated 1998:

Units 3175 and 3162 were rendering on N face  of oven 268 and covered both.

Rectangular feature in SW of space 117 situated on top of oven F286. Its walls are formed by 3353 which runs on NE and half way along west wall, the rest being formed by mudbrick wall 93.
The south wall of bin 256 is formed by wall 79.
Two other deposits help from the wall, 3367 to the E and 3374 to the NW. The walls stand 10-12cm high and are 80 to 90 degrees on the inside with moderate break of slope to a flat base. On the outside North they slope quite steeply 60 to 70 degrees. On the west they appear vertical but this is because the were truncated by the 1997 baulk section.
The bin was formed by cut [3354] which truncated the top of oven F268 forming a flattish base then the walls were added on top of this..
This cut truncated some of the rendering of oven F268, 3170. However, after the bin was built both the oven and the bin were rendered with 3175 and 3162 suggesting that at the later phases of the oven's use they were both in use at the same time, otherwise why not just render over then entrance of the oven after it had been backfilled. But then again why back fill the oven so carefully anyway?

Discussion:
The cut 3354 seems to have weakened the roof of the oven and made it collapse at some point ( this action given 'cut' number 3373). The last fill of the oven unit no 3124 seems to have been deposited from this hole in the roof. It is uncertain whether it was deliberately back filled in order to restore a base for bin 256 or whether it was accumulated deposits from the fill of F256 seeping through the whole of the roof after both went out if use.
There is the possibility that there were 3 phases of activity:
i, the oven in use on its own (the roof of original oven can be traced as scorching line on wall 79)
ii, the oven and bin 256 in use together 
iii, the bin in use after oven had been backfilled. 
None of these can be proved all that is certain is that the bin was built after the oven.

If the bin was used at the same time ad the oven it suggests some use as a drying / cooking receptacle. One of the bin fills, 2796 contained clay balls and burnt stone. The heat from the oven probably wouldn't have been sufficient to fire the clay or burn the stone though it would have been hot enough to warm them.
Alternatively they may have been dumped there later as a convenient place to get rid of them. The sides of the bin walls weren't burnt so there seems to be no fire installation in the bin itself."^^xsd:string ;

Clay bin. Oval in Shape. Cut away / at edge of / post retrieval pit. Built at the same time as F256 to West

Excavated 1998:
Cut by 2707 post-retrieval pit

Truncated feature to the East of oven F258 which it truncates on its eastern side and uses as its western wall. Its southern wall formed by wall 79 which it  abuts and its northern wall is separated into two micromorphology baulks and consists of many different contexts possibly signifying rebuilds, there is a general shift to the north. The eastern side of this feature is truncated by post retrieval pit 2707 so it is unknown how far it extended eastwards originally although the walls begin to curve back into wall 79 before truncation so probably not much further.

The base in it western half is formed by plaster layer 3731 which is the replastering of a previous feature beneath. the base steps down slightly in east and is formed by 2789 I think. Roddy thought this was bin wall collapse. I'm not sure but it may be make up to level base of bin. There is a chance that it stepped down further beneath this and feature beneath this 3658 was also part of bin but layer 23316 was over this and its equivalent in the western half was underneath walls of bin.
The northern wall on its north facing side was rendered with the same plaster that went over F268 oven and F256 bin so may have been in use at the same time as these. However there is no other evidence to suggest this except that ash deposit 2791 sealed base of bin and it is thought to be equivalent to 2798 & 2820 which is possibly debris from oven, although this is very tentative.
There were clay balls and burnt stone 1889 in base of bin. IT is not known if this was in situ from use or associated with abandonment of oven F268. A later deposit of burnt stone 2706 situated in bin cannot be from use as it is later than cut 2707 post retrieval pit."^^xsd:string ;

It consisted of red brownish clay on top, and strange mixture of \"pea gravel\" and sand, with inclusions such like charcoal and plant remains. It is not clear whether this layer contained fill of the bin or was just put in to level the base for future floor. 
In its second phase this bin is contemporary with the second phase of F. 780 an it appears to be earlier than F. 782. 
Removal of plaster floor from the second phase gave way to the layer of dark brown clay lumps and concentration of redeposited oven floor,soot, charred wood and burnt pottery. This material was taken out separately, as flotation sample 6 of unit #8474. New floor was discovered below this massive packing (phase 3), sloping towards the screen wall (F. 601).

There were two phases of this bin. The remains of two floors exist, even though badly preserved, and these two phases belong to the house Phase 2.

This part of the fill if this cut was taken out in #8292 before the wall was recognized (in 2001). The fill contained chunks of burnt clay, ash, packing made of yellowish clay. Below this was a rd clay \"floor\" covered with very thin layer of patchy white ash. This bricky packing was placed above a layer of mottled sediment (mixed material). While removing this layer, something that could be the floor of the bin - patchy plaster - was revealed. We tried to follow it, together with the ledge of the bin, but only a dirty floor surface appeared in some parts of the bin. The plaster previously discovered was soft and concentrated in blobs, mixed with red bricky material and grey sand. We came down to the salty \"surface\" which is different than the floor in the rest of the space, and could be ealier.
The wall of the bin rests on this salty, dirty floor, and is made of sandy tough material (unit 8427). Final removal of the bin wall (unit 8550) revealed that the bin was sitting on top of the last plaster floor in NW corner of buiilding 3 (#10)."^^xsd:string ;

It is not certain that it is found in situ, since this area is sloping towards south, so it could be that it slided from its original position. The argument could be that it is in a very bad state of preservation, with barely recognizable rims and a truncated base. That is why it was all excavated as one unit (#8614). Many animal holes in it make it hard to define the shape, but most probably it's rectangular. It was made of orange red siltu clay; bin's walls were tightly attached to the walls of the space (south and west). The base (maybe more than one, it's hard to say) is sitting on black-grey middeny soil and is also made of orange, but greasy clay, similar to that in the rest of the space, so they are probably contemporary."^^xsd:string ;

Under fill 10284 a bone cluster was identified and also few stones were present.
The floor 11920 is very friable and we don't exclude the possibility of it being just the upper floor and have previous others underneath.
The bin is closed at east and north by walls 2007 and 2008 which are the outer walls of  space 93.
The western part and the southern one is closed by wall 11922 which functions also as wall for bins F. 2002 and 2005.
Between these two features wall 11922 was truncated all the way down to the floor of the bin, again partly by the demolition of the house and partly by the archaeologist. 
This bin was not as rich in organic material as the features 2002 and 2004 and it was probably empty at the moment of wall/roof collapse, that being the reason for 11922 to break and also for the fill 10284 to be actually building material demolished.

The fills 11900-11908 all contain organic material (cereals, almonds) in small concentration points.  

That might have happened because the original fill of the bin got contaminated with bits of building material at the moment of building collapse.

Fill 11919 is a more clayie fill on the bottom of the bin and besides a bone tool it also contained a large number of obsidian blades.

The bin is square with rounded crners and it's 55cm x 55cm in dimensions; preserved on a heght of 50cm.  The back wall of it is room wall 2007 and the bin seems to have been built against it at a later stage.  Argument for that hypothesis is that the plaster layers on 2007 go uninterrupted behind the side walls of bin at junctions.  

The side walls: 
-the northern one is common wall for bins 2005 and 2003, separating the two.  It is about 12-13cm thick and it is plastered on both sides.
-the southern one is separating bin 2005 from 2004 and it's very narrow but plastered on both sides.  
-the western side wall of bin is very similar to the southern one and were treated as one curved wall.

All three side walls were preserved up to the level of surface scraping, being identified as such from the first day.  All three got truncated by the archaeologist.

The fact that the walls of 2005 were intact indicates that the bin was full at the moment of abandonment, while 2003 and 2004 were not entirely full and their walls got broken by the house collapse.

Fills:
-the lower half of bin was filled as follows: the eastern half was filled with a clay pike in the intention of reducing the capacity of it.  The western half was filled with cruciferae seeds. Both tese fills were sealed by another clay fill which by the apearance of it seems to have been placed there intentionally.  This could be part of a storage or processing process.

The walls and the bottom of the bin were excavated in 2013 whowing that it was costructed together with the bin F2004 right after (during the same construction event) that wall (before plastering of those walls)."^^xsd:string ;

Originally two openings, 0.5 x 0.7 m wide, the larger probably the access and to the north of the smaller; after remodelling, new access was 0.9 m wide and to the south of the original larger one.

Discussion:
Two-\"phase\" remodelling of access between spaces 70 and 71; primary phase involved some levelling (2152) of the original opening of which there were two (large access, and smaller hatch/window) and then blocking of lower parts of access still standing with 2128/2129; second \"phase\" involved re-building of wall over larger access. The \"phases\" are based solely on changes in brick and mortar and in reality the blocking and reconstruction are probably part of the same event. A horn core was set into the south of the wall relief F 48/F 25. This and the surrounding mudbrick and mortar was removed in 1996 due to its fragile/vulnerable state, the rest in 1997."^^xsd:string ;

Multiple inhumation burials - latest (1466) was headless articulated adult, with numerous disturbed / disarticulated bones in fill: (1928), (1364) and (1467). However, these 3 bone groups may belong to cut [1927] (whatever that really is) having been dislodged to make way for (1466). In that case, this feature is not the contents of a single cut.

Discussion:
The problems, as explained over is that skeleton 1466 seems to be in a nice cut by itself. What happened to the skull is unknown, though there are several surplus ones in (1470) contained within cut [1927]. This contains three groups of bones, apparently pushed aside when 1466 was buried. therefore there should be 2 burial numbers in some ways, on the other hand, if these bones were redeposited dring the 1466 burial episode, maybe they do belong to burial 29 even if they were previously buried during separate episodes. The shape of cut [1470] suggests it is in fact 3 different cuts - a N, as SW & a SE cut, all now mixed up."^^xsd:string ;

Group includes two fully articulated inhumations (1922=1939) and (1924), and one semi-articulated/articulated portion of another individual (1925=1975). Most were excavated in 1996, the latter two units in 1997.

Discussion:
Multiple burials grouped under one feature number; from the cut plan and the section plan, different interment events can be identified at least for the three \"articulated\" skeletons (see sketch plan). Note that the matrix shows the total/final sequence of events which means that the skeletons are not necessarily in the order of original interment but rather their redeposited position. The original order of deposition is probably as follows: all the fully disarticulated bones are the primary interments (though probably also representing different episodes): 1923, 1926, 1975, 2520, 1937; next course 1925/1938, followed by 1924, and finally 1922=1939. If this sequence is correct, it shows the interments moving away from the northwest corner and wall F 3 into the centre of the platform F 13. Burial F 38 thus constitutes a minimum of four burial events, probably more like six/or the total number of individuals represented. The relationships between the three \"articulated\" skeletons were worked out on the basis of their physical relationships.

Discussion:
Double burial seems deliberately placed at the base of the wall relief F26; in terms of the stratigraphy, these burials were placed up against the primary phase of F26, a probable plastered post. Two points can be made: - this 'post' possibly represents a kind of threshold or spatial division of space 71 into the east & west halves when paired with F24. Second, the grave cut may even be a cut for the removal of the post of F24 which clearly removed something associated with that feature.

This feature comprises a burial found while excavating Unit 7549.  That unit consisted of clearing topsoil and scraping to render the archaeological deposit(s) visible for rough planning (see Plan 03-026).  Excavation revealed a plaster platform which wsa badly eroded to the north, where the skeleton was thus exposed.  It was apparently buried below the platform, and although the burial matrix was not solid plaster, there were plaster inclusions mixed throughout the soil of the burial fill.  We were unable to define any clear burial cut. 
A bifacial obsidian point (7549-X1) was set in the plaster platform ýtself, we discovered when cutting part of the platform in order to access the burial.,
Removal of the entire skeleton (in many small pieces) revealed that it was nearly complete, but the head and feet were conspicuously absent.  Some human bone removed ýn the topsoil layer may account for those partsö but not in their entirety, suggesting either their original absence or the skeleton's prior exposure.

The second individual 8817 is located below 8802, and oriented south-north. It lies on its right side with legs flexed east-west. Especially bones of the upper body and the skull are missing

Some bones of the upper body might have been collected as miscellaneous bones in the fill, unit 8803. Other bones collected as 8803 duplicate those of 8802 and 8817, and were subsequently assigned to skeleton unit 8844.

Finally, the remains (leg bones) of a fourth individual were found in the north-east, below skeleton 8817, but was not further exposed in 2003.

Thus this burial feature remains to be completely excavated!!

In the burial some 18 beads and a clay object were found that could not be directly associated with one individual or another, and were collected in the fill unit (8803).

  c:description "F.1244 is a Neolithic multiple burial placed in the northwest corner of a building on the basis of walls visible after the removal of topsoil. 
The remains of numerous individuals were present in the fill but the most articulated body appears to be skeleton 8813. The bone was in very bad condition and difficult to separate into different skeletons. However, skeleton numbers were mainly assigned to skull/mandible elements to provide some estimate of the number of individuals since these elements preserve better and can be aged more accurately. Some of the skeletons may have been split between more than one unit number but there seems to be between 5 and 7 individuals present representing both adult, subadult and juvenile skeletons.
The burials were lying directly over a plaster floor; this would have probably been a floor from previous building to the one that the burials are associated with and formed a good base to the burial pit. This plaster floor was slightly sloped with the northern side higher; on the southern side the burial and its underlying plaster floor had been cut by two later burial (F.1242 and F.1402-see relevant feature sheets discussions of these). The first of these cuts had caused a significant quantity of bone from F.1244 to slump into its cut; a number of bones from F.1244 could be seen lying on the edge of cut [8834].
Skeleton 8813 was buried with a stamp seal (8813x1) and a marble? elongated, rectangular bead (8813x2). The stamp seal was located between the distal femur (8813)and some dentition (both 8841 or 8842) and under a rib suggesting that it may have been placed between the head and knees of a crouched burial.
The X-finds mentioned above and many of the X-finds from the burial fill were recovered in a concentration perhaps suggesting that they were buried in a group. These also include two bear teeth and worked stones, a bone ring preform and a bone 'fork'. Other finds were recovered from the flotation and include a bead made from a stratified rock and a white bead of similar shape to those found in F.1242"^^xsd:string ;

However, this feature contained only very few fragments of bone, within a back fill deposit, suggesting that if this was a grave, then it had been removed and the cut cleaned.
Another possible explanation could be a basin. Deposit (10416), a strange lumpy clay layer, hints at water being present (in the very least present at its deposition) but is by no means conclusive. Even afetr excavation the excavator is still uncertain and undecided as to what it is/represents.

  c:description "Neonate/infant burial. Grave first seen in section left by Mellaart during excavation in the 1960s as a small cut below upper plaster surface (10407) of platform F1501. Upon excavation this was confirmed which has proved to be interesting. It means that the burial was cut into make up layer (10448), the packing layer in between plaster surfaces (10407) and (10451). Normally, burials relating to platforms are cut into the plaster and then replastered, often with what looks like an inferior quality plaster, which must sink and provides hollows within the platforms surface. Perhaps this method is a way of conquering this problem and to provide a nice smooth plastered surface, with no cuts or blemishes.
Apparently no comparisons are known, so interpretation is both difficult and objective. Are we looking at a change in method as a whole, or a one-off event for a purpose we havent thought of? It survives in a building at Level 4 or 5, fairly high up in the sequence, so it could be that it is a methodological change. And are we to assume that this large community did everything in the same way, including burial practices? Surely methods changed from house to house, family to family. And as a neonate/infant, is this an explanation to a different approach?
Or does this different method show a change to attempt to deal with the obvious problem of the smell of decomposition. Was this an attempt to deal with the problem, to cap the burial within a final layer of plaster, c.0.01m thick.

This is a clear indication of the link between burial and replastering."^^xsd:string ;

The body is on the back and the knees are drawn upwards to the right of the chest. The arms are bent and both converge on the right shoulder.
On the skeleton a number of objects were found. On the left part of the chest a large bone hook was found (x1). On the right chest, below the left leg, a cluster of 5 flint objects and one antler point (cluster 10835) was found.
The skeleton requires further study but a first assement indicates we are dealing with an adult male.
Directly below the skeleton reddish brown discolorations of the matrix were encountered, which may be the remains of some kind of organic material, but could also be the result of the leaching of the weaker bone tissues, such as ribs and vertebrea. Two samples were taken in unit 10831.
Burial 1709 disturbed earlier burial 1711 (skeleton 10814), whose bones were placed along the edge of burial 1709 (the remainder is located below 10813. The skull of 10814 was found in post retrieval pit 1705, and appears to have been lifted at the time 10813 was interred.
In order to position the bones of 10814 along the edge of f. 1709 the cut 10830 must have included the scatter of these bones along the periphery of skeleton 10813. On that basis an arbitrary cut - unit 10830 was defined around the skeletal elements of 10813 and those of 10814. Other than that no difference in matrix (between fill 10831 and matrix 10812 to the north) or cut edge was recognized. 

To the west 10813 was positioned with its skull on top of skeleton 10829, but the latter skeleton was not disturbed. Nonetheless it is clear that 10813 was interred at a later date."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Feature 1702 is a double burial feature located in the center of the north platform of space 112. Due to a variety of reasons the level from which the feature was dug can no longer be established, but the cut was visible directly after the removal of the isolated weathered patches of floors, unit 10806, left in the 1960s. 

The feature is disturbed by later burials 1709; 1710; and 1711, and post retrieval pit 1705. 

The cut of 1702, u. 10811 is of a very large size. The nature of this cut only became clear when the double burial at the bottom of the feature was encountered. In the south a male adult was interred - unit 10840, which was oriented east-west (head in west), legs flexed before chest. With this person we found a large worked bird bone (x1 10840), a large flint object and a bone point (x2,x3 10842). On the skeleton some red paint was sprinkled. On the chest there was a white substance that may be plaster and behind the neck there was a gold-brown matrix that may be an organic residue (samples 2 and 3 10842). 
Above the fill surrounding 10840, unit 10842, there was a brown interface with phytoliths upon which the matrix broke evenly (sample 1 10838). This interface slopes down considerably to the north, and it is on top of this that a complete sheep skeleton, unit 10839, was found. This sheep, which is not yet mature (NR), lay on its back. The hind legs were extended at an angle of about 30 degrees. The front legs were sticking up vertically (removed as cluster 10828). Given this odd position of 10839 it has been posited (NR) that the front legs were held while feature 1702 was infilled (fill units 10838 and 10812).
Although f. 1702 was disturbed by several later burials it seems that some knowledge of f. 1702 influenced these burials. First, the northern area, with the upsticking sheep front legs was avoided. Perhaps this area was not considered fit for humans. Second two of the skeletons (10814 of f 1711) and (10813 of f 1709) were in exactly the same location and burial position as 10840."^^xsd:string ;

The W-E orientation and proximity to other burials similarly oriented identified it as likely to be a grave, but the narrowness at the W end (0.38m N-S) was cause for doubt as that was much narrower than the others uncovered. The cut also seemed more irregular than the others, being rectangular in overall shape but flaring N-S through the cut wall. There were few inclusions in the fill, and it was looser than the surrounding soil. The burial was shallow relative to the others nearby, seemingly contemporaneous, burials, and erosion had brought the surface even nearer the skeleton.  As such, the skeleton was in bad shape and further disturbed by numerous animal holes (left arm and hand missing, both feet missing). The base of the burial cut was quite irregularö with the East end higher than the West. The cut was at times difficult to follow due to similarity between the fill and the surrounding soil, resulting in the E end being dug past approx. 10 cm, to the E edge of the 2004 season of the 4040 opening.

  c:description "F. 1450 was defined by its colour, texture and a Roman tegula, which was put in an upright position at the skull. The area slopes from W to E with the E being at a lower elevation. The fill of the grave was gray-brown in colour, with red hints. It contained small amount of obsidian flakes, animal bones, pottery sherds and charcoal (tiny bits). After we removed the fill, a skeletton, dorsally extended from W to E (head to W) was found (for a detailed description of the skeleton see U. sheet 8852). The bones were not very well preserved and the lower 2/3 of tibiat fibula of the right leg was missing. The lower 1/2 of tibiat fibula of the left leg was missing too. Both feet were missing together with a tile. The body was laid on 5 (initially 6) Roman tegulae (tiles). A tile in an upright position was placed at the head. A copper (?) pin/needle was found at the lower part of the ribs at the right side of the skeleton. No other grave goods were found.
The inclusions of the burial fill were (in my opinion) not related to the skeleton. The tiles, which the skeleton rested on, together with the one at the head were part of the grave construction.
The burial cut had a rectangular shape in plan, with square corners at the head. The corners at the feet were not possible to  be identified because the easternmost part of the grave was destroyed (by erosion or/and human activity probably). The sides of the cut were vertical, its base was flat. The cut was made in a harder bricky layer (walls or wall destructions?), orange-reddish in colour and sandy in texture. For a detailed description of the burial cut see U. sheet 8851).

The unusually wide grave cut may also indicate that they had anticipated that the body needed extra width compared to normal. Inside the fill was a large iron object which looked as though, from its position, it may hav ebeen some sort of plaque or fastener on the coffin. There is another, presumably related, iron piece which is too large to be a normal nail. Throughout the rest of the grave are scattered nails forming no particular pattern, one was up against the right side of the skull. In the NW corner of the grave was a bulbous glass vase, still intact, which is of a different form from the rest of those found in the area, and much more robust.

It is possible that there is a small niche or opening immediately west of the infant which may account for the irregularity of the wall face here. No wall plaster and the face of the wall is quite ragged which could indicate that the wall face was scoured into to create a cavity for the infant BUT the platform is fully intact, plastered and no sign of damege by a cut and also the platform abuts the leanm in the wall which suggests the wall hang is original.

An arbitrary cut (unit 10832) was assigned to the burial given that a real cut could not be established. A number of beads were found in the vicinity of the skeleton and collected in this unit.

The arbitrary fill layer to the arbitrary cut could not be differentiated from the surrounding matrix of unit 10812.

In terms of stratigraphical relationships the following relations can be noted. Feature 1710 is overlain by burial feature 1709, given that the skeleton of the latter, unit 10813, overlies that of f. 1710, unit 10829. In particular, the skull of 10829 lies on one of the tibia of 10813.

  c:description "This feature was excavated and recorded as a burial cut even though there was no body in it, except for a phalanx of an adult individual. Since it resembled a mudbrick lined burials excavated at the TP's area and yielded iron nails and late pottery sherds (terra sigilata inclusively), we thought it was a disturbed burial from which the body has been removed (the human bone). Analyses of the material yielded by the fill (U. 8865) might produce some more human bones. However the grave was backfilled with the surrounding midden and the human bone might be just occasional. In such case the possible interpretation might be that the grave construction went wrong and (judging by the dimensions, especially the width of the grave, the poor condition and the fragmentation of the mudbricks) and that it was abandoned.
2 things puzzle me about it though:
1) Larger part of the feature was covered by Neolithic midden but I guess this is due to the erosion and the sliding down of the midden deposits as well as covering with the surrounding midden soil in case of abandonment.
2) In the small section lrft for the bricks about 15 cm higher up than the rest, we could see 2 courses of bricks and a mortar line inbetween but the width of bricks in plan was only 10 cm, as if they were laid vertically along the side (S side with double lining). Was it their original width or they have been cut?
F. 1452 is a Lte Roman ''false bottom'' burial.
It was first recognized as a cut with a mudbrick lining in sp. 226 next to the S wall (F. 1458) of the space. The fill enclosed within the mudbricks was removed and the ''false bottom'' of the burial, consisting of beige mudbricks, was exposed. It covered a skeleton of a young adult male, dorsally extended, left hand on hip. The head poins the W. There were no grave goods encountered. A white residue was visible around the skull and the right side of the skeleton, and traces of wood and iron nail were found as well. It is possible that the body was wrapped in a matting or thick fabric. It remains unclear what was the function of the nails as there was no room for a coffin ot similar construction.
The grave cut was rectangular, with square corners, vertical sides and a flat base. For further details see unit sheets 8865-67, 8878, 8879.
Both upper (U. 8865) and lower (U. 8878) fills yielded small clay horns, which are most probably related to the Neolithic midden deposit with which the grave was backfilled."^^xsd:string ;

The story began on 15.07 when Tania removed plastery rim of this feature and excavated the cut to a depth of app. 40 cm and stopped after hitting hard construction rubble across the ''bottom''. The cut stayed like that for days and when I finally started cleaning it in order to complete the paper work - the skull  popped out underneath the rubble. The position of the body and the inclusions/finds in the burial fill (late pottery. iron nails) undoubtfully indicated a Late Roman/Byzantine burial. The burial pit itself is quite large with unexpected slope of the E side. The iron nail indicated the existence of a coffin or some other type of wooden structure, which unfortunately was not encountered. My interpretation would be that this construction was sealed by hard clay construction rubble, which formed the ''false bottom'' of the grave (see F. 1452). It is still uncertain what was the function of the plastery rim on the surface but it definitely seems to be in relation with the burial. (some of it was also found in the cut).

The cut is sub-rectangular in plan and rather unevenly cut through with a flatish base.  The sides are gently sloping to the west but stepped and uneven to the east.  This is reflected in the position of the skeleton which lay in a crouched position with the upper body partly raised up the edge of the cut.  The body lay on its right side with the head to the south with both hands apparently drawn up in front of the face. The right knee was raised up in front of the ribcage with the right foot positioned in front of the pelcis.  The left lower femur lay at 90 degrees to the trunk with the lower leg tightly flexed back so the left foot just below the pelvis.  A heavy concentration of phytolith material lay in front of the ribcage and over the right leg and appears to represent a layer of reed matting or something placed  over this part of the body.  Around the skeleton and in the overlying grave fill were  numerous small animal  bones though none apparently in articulation.  There were also concentrations of owl pellet  material in the fill, which were sampled.  The burial appears to have been cut quite deeply  into the infill 4325, probably from the floor  level in space 163 (Mellaart  Shrine 10 level 8), probably a total depth of in excess of 80cm though only 52cm was recovered during excavation.

The body appears to have been just 'thrown in' rather than deliberately placed, and this together with the rather rough and uneven cut of the grave suggests an unceremonious burial, particularly in comparison with F.513 which shows apparent deliberate placing of the body and other materials in the grave.

The skeleton is apparently that of a young adult male.  The upper fill of the burial was truncated by a later burial  of a baby F.442 though this was not deep enough to disturb the lower skeleton, indeed the only disturbance appears to have been by  small animal activity which redistributed a number of the smaller bones."^^xsd:string ;

Therefore it is conceivable that it was cut into the platform at one point in time of the life of the platform.  The infant, 6 months < 1 year was placed very carefully within the small cut.  Head to west, legs at east in a crouched position.  The infant was placed on a matt which could have been made from reed or other grasses.  This has left an impression to the south, to the east near the feet and around the head area.  Attached to the skeleton were wrist bracelets made of bone and/or coloured stone, blue, amberisy, black and white.

stone bracelets around each wrist, bone bell-shaped anklets around each ankle with a covering of red ochre (sampled). Lies within cut [4404]. Lifted by Kent and Charlie.

Covering the body and certainly concentrated to the east and south was red ochre.  No signs of any garments were visible.  Jewellery is possibly only funerary as they seem large for a baby.

(sf 2000) As the platform was so heavily truncated it is probable that the cut was missed during excavation and that the burial cut this platform, as oposed to a foundation burial. Could the artefacts with this infant indicate a special standing as could the fact that it was the only one associated with the platform."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Crouched burial of a young adult male cut into infill in space 163.  Skeleton (4593) was orientated E-W and lay on its back.  Both legs were tightly flexed with both knees raised up to the level of the lower ribcage but spread wide, with the feet positioned just below the pelvis.  The right humerus lay parallel with the torso, with the right ulna and radius bent at 90 degrees across the lower torso.  The left humerus lay almost parallel to the torso with the left ulna and radius flexed such that the left hand lay over the pelvis. The right hand lay over the left ulna and radius.  The skull had been removed, probably post-burial but prior to full decay of the flesh.  Under the left side of the ribcage and upper right femur lay patches of phytolith concentrations (4617) suggesting a woven textile once lay under the body and possibly lined the cut (4612).  In the fill over the body (4464) lay another patch of phytolith impressions (s5 and s7), to the right side of the skeleton, possibly the remains of plant material laid over the body.  Above this and covering a large part of the body was the remains of a large piece of wood (4460), part carbonised, part mineralised.  This appeared to be a large plank (it was no more than 2cm thick) and was later identified as hackberry.  This may have served either as a burial cover or may have been used to protect the body when it was re-excavated to remove the head.  It may even be possible that the wood, given its position , may have served some kind of symbolic role in the burial of this young adult male."^^xsd:string ;

Feature 1007 was discovered from a burial cut in floor 2. This cut was distinct as brown fill within the white plaster floor. No burial lid was evident. The western edge of the cut was clear while the eastern portion was disturbed by the cut made for F. 1005.

The skeleton from F. 1005 (sk 8423) was buried after #8490 and #8494 and disturbed the cranium for #8490 which was displaced eastward and at a higher elevation.

The feature consists of an infant folded in a basket. It was discovered by the Bach team in 2002 who stabilized the basket and covered it for future excavation. The burial was disturbed by an animal burrow and some of the infants bone lay loose in the fill. As the burial was disturbed we decided not to try to lift the basekt in one piece in order to protect the undisturbed part of the infants bones as well as protect the bones of the other individual that lay directly under the basket, unit 8598.

  c:description "Grave/burial feature. Cut contained partially articulated remains of an adult, mostly likely male. Cut of burial fairly diffuse, and for a long time was not clear, missing due to midden deposits into which this grave is cut, but also due to heavy truncated by NS grave, F1512. Both cuts and relationships were only revealed after much of the cut was excvated.

Much of the grave and skeleton has been disturbed, and disarticulated adult bone that can be associated with sk(10499) was recovered from the highly disturbed backfill of [10459] F1512.

The grave has been cut at a later date, and indeed a later phase within the construction of building 42 by another grave cut [10459]. Due to this level of truncation, only a very small percentage of articulation remained. Although the cut of the later grave was not easy to determine during excavation, the abrupt start of articulation to the eastern end of [10468] provides a sound suggestion to the level of this truncation.

A tool cache was also found in direct relation to the burial located just to the SE of the pelvis. 3 stone (obsidian and flint) tools were displayed in an upstanding formation, overlapping one another. All tools were not locally made, most likely originating from Sothern Cappadoccia. 2 otother tools were also found.

  c:description "Burial/ grave of female skeleton (11306), within grave cut [11307]. Interesting and important with regards to construction, phasing and purpose of building 42. Adult female, tightly flexed, preientated E-W onits left side, within an extremely tight cut, which is well defined within midden depost (11347). Preservation of skeletal remains fairly good, although extensive animal burrowing did disturb some areas, such as the skull. Eastern exten of cut lost to truncation by F1513 and sever animal damage. Northern edge also slightly distorted and not yet clear due to presence of claymarl (11300), (as yet unexcavated-- represents strategraphic problem that needs to be dealt within on coming season).

Purhaps the most important and interesting feature of this grave is the presence of plastered and subsequently painted skill of an elderly adult, not yet gendered (largely due to method of excavation by conservators). Technically a grave good(?) but unit no (11330) given to identify this strange and important feature. Placed between the arms of the female the skull faces the chest , clutched tightly into the body in a clear demonstration of possesion and significance. Who was the elder whom the skull represents? Was it a relative whoose inclusion in this grave is ultimately significant?

What can be said about this grave is that it appears to have instigated the building of platform F1501. Cut into midden deposits from the phase of building below this is a clear example of burial practice determining construction and architectural erection. The burial is central to the NE platform, a feature that must have not gone unnoticed. Building 42 created in a single construction phase, seen by two platforms F1501 +F1502 and bench F1503, ultimately derived from this burial and its importance.

This cut is also likely to contain neonate burial (10498) F1516. A tentative cut no [10496] was assigned (see relevant units) but due to closeness of individuals it may be suggested that both relate to one another. Only 0.03 of fill separate the two skeletons. It is almost as if (11306) was laid into the grave, in its tight flexed position and with its plastered skull in place, the grave was begun to be backfilled when it was realised that the neonate was not in the grave as it should be. An unlikely event, but possible. It is suspcted that both are related in some way, whether a closeness in time of death etc. both we cut through midden material and both related to the pre- construction phase of the building and both have likely instigated the building of platform F1501.

Plastered skull (11330) was lifted by the conservation team. (11306) was lifted around the skull to created a larger working space. A pre-constructed box was placed around the skull.  Bone was consolidated and sand and pading was added around the bone within the box. This was then lifeted to allow better excavation and conservation."^^xsd:string ;

From Human Remains Report 2005:

F. 2050, (11657) (1 child)
The remains of this individual (11657) were located in the southeast part of the burial pit.  This was the headless body from a child of ~10 years of age.  The head of (11657) has not yet been identified in the disarticulated heads associated with the burial pit.  The body was in a tightly flexed position on its left side.  The left hip was the only other missing element.  The right arm was bent 90 degrees with the right hand at the left elbow.  The left upper arm was alongside the body with the elbow slightly bent and the hand at the pelvis.  The legs were loosely flexed with the ankles together.  A string (or strings) of beads and animal teeth (possibly from a single animal; badger or dog), was found around the ankles of (11657).  This is the only individual in the burial pit with grave goods associated with it. 

(11657) may have been disturbed during the interment of another individual in the same area of the platform at a later date.  The later burial of (11493) is the most likely candidate.  It is clear that the head of (11657) was taken after the decomposition of the body had taken place since the uppermost cervical vertebrae are present, suggesting that the skull was taken when flesh and/or cartilage would not have been an issue."^^xsd:string ;

This feature number therefore collates a number of burial features (F.1344, F.1346, F.1347, F.1348, F.2050) all of which are associated with fill (11608). 

With the introduction of the MNI calculation through the H.remains DB, a problem occurred that the MNI was repeatedly calculating MNI from fill (11608) as the fill was asociated with all the above associated features. 

Therefore the fill (11608) was removed from burial feature records  (F.1344, F.1346, F.1347, F.1348, F.2050), and only kept associated with F.1343 to address this problem BUT in reality  represents the fill around all the above features. F.1343 and fill (11608) should therefore be viewed as the 'parent' feature and fill.

Burials F.1349, F.2051 and F.2052, also within F.1343 were allocated different fill numbers as were more discretely associated with the skeletons."^^xsd:string ;

Cuts later grave F1515, which contained a partially articulated adult male.

It is suggested, then, that this feature was originally a grave cut for said juvenile, and then for whatever reason, was removed, only to be thrown back into the cut and being mixed with the skeleton (10499) below.

Several interesting artefactual pieces were found amonst this deposit, which also suggest this. Most importantly was the mother goddess figurine, found amongst the disarticulated bone. Originally thought to be associated with a grave (what we thought during excavation) in a secure context this theory was soon dismissed as unliikely, due to the high level of disarticualtion. The figurine, unfortunately, could have literally come from anywhere, and cannot be argued with any great certainity. It may be associated, or have been at some point, with either of the two graves. Alternatively, it could well have come from the midden deposits in which both graves cut. Or, of course, it could well have come from elsewhere and simply deposited during the backfilling of the grave. Perhaps the backfilling and disruption to the grave was a significant event, and the goddess acts as a marker for this. We will never know, but it is fair to reflect and remark on its significance, and mostly likely represents a very special deposit.

There were no grave goods nor traces of wood coffins as have been found elsewhere. Skeleton (12386) in F.2170 was that of an adult male.

The portion of the cut exposed on the trench floor contains portions of probably 3 infant burials (10330, 10335, 10336). SK 10335 is partially exposed through bottom of Neolithic wall section. Remains were excavated to, but not into, the section. SK 10330 is an articulated infant within the exposed portion of the cut along the NW wall of the cut. Skull was not in contiutiy with this skeleton. The peepest layer, SK 10336, consists of skull and right tibia and fibula only. There may prove to be part of SK 10330.
Infants are very small, indicating Neolithic or early infant development. Preservtion of skulls was poor because of the thin bone and exposure to sun, heat and wind. Preservation of the long bones, ribs and vertabrae is quite good as they were protected by burial fill.
The remainder of this burial cut will be excavated in sequence in the future."^^xsd:string ;

All four were east-west oriented, but only three of them (F.2162,  F.2170 and F.2187) were lined with very solid, carefully prepared clay, while the fourth (F.2169) was a simple skeleton placed in the cut. The skeletons were laid all in the same position, with the head to west dorsally extended, slightly on the right side and similar to other burials in the vicinity. Only three of the four graves (F.2162, F.2170 and F.2169) contained skeletons, while F.2187 was empty.

F.2162 and F.2170 are identical side-by-side graves, with skeletons placed on their right side placed in rectangular cuts with sides lined with thick clay. There were no grave goods nor traces of wood coffins as have been found elsewhere. Skeleton (12386) in F.2170 was that of an adult male. The lower legs had been subsequently disturbed and moved towards the torso. Skeleton (12384) in F.2162 was an approximately six-eight year old child.

This raises two problems: 
- This platform shows very clear evidence of bruning. Its SW part has been very affected by fire (Black and soft plaster). Yet, only B52 has burned. (B51 was constructed inside B52, in an area cleard of burning residues:)
- But, in plans and synthesis of B52, this platform is still called PLT 1575 (B51's number...). 
So: This platform we started excavating: should it be associated with B51? In this case, burning evidence on its top does not make sense. Or, should it be associated with B52? In this case, should we change its feature number, and the platform must have been excavated until the top of B52's remains of burnt plaster in previous excavation seasons?
Despite that it has been said in reports that Sp.94 in B52 was never really excavated (only the floor was reached) it has been possible to realize that parts of the platform were removed anyway (by compairing pictures of hte excavation of B51 and B52 \"excavated\").
Thus: The layer u10319 (white and not affected by fire) corresponds to the reconstruction of the platform when B51 was build after B52's burning. It thus corresponds to PLT 1575.
But: the first layer excavated this year: u.20615, just under u.10319, corresponds to the remains (after 7 years of erosion) of burnt plaster laying on the top of the B52's platform. This platform should be called differently (PLT F. 3695) (being part of another building)."^^xsd:string ;

Approximately half way down there is an overhang of bricks in the northern part of the wall and a step in the southern. This could indicate that it was built in two phases.


Further excavation in 2013 by A. klimowicz:

Feature 3627 was assigned as the Eastern wall of the Sp.488/489. It was erected directly after performing foundation cut through thick (1,40m) midden deposit and finding a ground stable enough to set the wall. The obtained data from the eastern section indicate that there must have been a grand need to erect the structure (B.108) on the particular spot (location) and the work was conducted under a pressure so that must have caused of course constructional mistakes. One of the inaccuracy was evidenced within Eastern wall (F. 3627) in particular in a slumping first five brick courses (U.20676) Eastward, and then performing thicker mortar (U.20677) just to maintain a flat and horizontal level after the fault.
The subsequent 6th course of the bricks was in that case a kind of repairing phase that was emphasized by the presence of a ledge. The overhangs (5-8cm) attempted to keep vertical line in subsequent upper part of the wall, that started inundated just after setting the first mentioned courses due to unstable (midden-like) ground."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Feature 3623 together with F.3624 had been assigned as the southern walls of Space 489. The wall F.3623  (U.19441-bricks; U.20675-mortar) comprised the eastern section of mentioned structure and like its western counterpart (F.3624) was erected after preparing foundation cut through the midden. The foot of the feature reached the bottom of the soft dumping deposits and it stood directly on the surface of earlier wall, made of dark-grey bricks and mid/light-orange mortar, creating solid foundation and proper surface to set on its base the factual structure of B.108. At the stage of recording the section of the feature (see plan 13/20, 13/21) and afterward in the course of its excavation it was possible to evidence the irregularities within the construction, that were caused probably by the lack of space (in the narrow foundation cut) and disability to maintain faultless course of bricks keeping also parallel thickness of mortar. The majority of the faults in the wall was evidenced within exposed in 2013 Western part of the feature, where in some points thick mortar layer was arranged instead a brick (see section 13/20 & 13/21). It is possible that the letter as well as an overlap between Southern walls (3623,3624) indicate that their erection had been conducted from both sides (Eastern and Western) independently. The statement assume possibility that builders started raising the wall F.3623 from the deepest point in southern section, that means from S-E corner due to bond that wall with the Eastern one. At the same time in opposite corner (S-W), however at higher elevation, the wall F.3624 had been erected separately. The desynchronized construction caused by different foot levels of both walls and afterward setting several courses toward the central part of the structure independently, resulted in missed contour line and overlapping the construction (see plan12/305). Therefore in the central part the builders were forced to provide appropriate techniques to join both constructions by the usage of thicker mortar."^^xsd:string ;

Thus the feature has two stages; 1) It was first built against the later addition F.3698 (bin) and F.7306 (bin). The construction itself consists of an elevated surface of packed clay with stones. 2) On top of it was a stone setting, a clear deposition before filling the room. In short terms the feature shows both usage and abandonment. However the usage itself might as well be associated to abandonement, although this is not really likely because it was on a phytolithic floor (? See discussion u. 30593) which was stratigraohically lower than the latest floor (u.30544) level in Sp18.

This packing is situated strategically in the passage between in Sp17 and 18. It was probably built to further mark this liminal area. It might also have had a step-function as it seems it covered the floor all the way to S wall F.3655. This is seen in stone impressions (see sketch).

  c:description "This burial was dug in platform F.3695 and was the last one dug in that platform. The cut (u. 20648) seems to cut originaly the red painted layer u.20634 (but the erosion of the upper layers of platform F.3695 could lead to the possibility that the cut could also affect a latter stage of the platform now disappeared). 
This last use of the platform as a funeral space has to be associated with building 52 and not building 51 (which had a re-constructed platform just above, after the burning of building 52), and so with platform F.3695 and not platform F.1575. Indeed, all the infill of the cut u.20648 shows the same taphonomical process as the platform F.3695 itself : a southwest side affected by the fire, and a northeast side not as much affected. Thus, burial F.7112 has been affected by the burning of building 52 and is earlier than this event. 
It is interesting to note than the re-use of the same platform emplacement during the occupancy of building 51 did not disturb this previous burial of building 52. Just like if beyond the intentional burning, the idea of continuity was strong enough to prevent such practices. Which is different than most of the buildings without rupture of such a deliberate burning and reconstruction and where burial are yet steadily disturbed by new cuts. This should led us to re-consider the nature and implication of the deliberate destruction of building.
Burial F.7112 was a pretty simple primary burial of an adult person, buried heavely contracted. This position was very tightly held by bandages (phytoliths were found around femurs, pelvis, ankles and ilium). 
Two shells (one of them with red ochre) were the only recognized artifacts of the fill going with that skeleton.
The cut is very deep but the infill seems completely homogeneous (except for some parts which are more affected by the fire and thus change by the consistency and the colours but are exactly the same as the rest). This finfill was divided in three arbitrary layers (u.20651, u.20652, u.20654). Only the top of the cut seems different: a very thin layer of plaster (u.20650) was laying on top of the infill and the cut was \"closed\" by a thick seal of plaster (u. 20644) very distinct from the platform plaster (u. 20634)."^^xsd:string ;

Although fairly shallow (0.05m) these would still be deep enough to support a pillar, maybe approx. 0.5m.
The cut appears to go through the top layer of plaster (10407), but stops directly above the plaster surface below. There is no evidence to suggest that the pillar and niche were in place before the addition of the top plaster surface, I.e. no signs of lipping.

Regular, vertically sided recess, excapt to south where it has been disturbed by animal burrows. Recess infilled with silty material - brick type fragments, probably accumulated although poss backfill, depth of 6cm makes it hard to say.
Similar and better preserved niche F1508 is located in platform F1501 to NE (see F1508).

Niche/recess appears to be some sort o architectural elaboration of platform F1502. It is possible a short pillar, similar to 'bulcrania' pillars mentioned in Mellaarts excavation was located here. This feature has been removed and recess not replastered so one can suggest tis occurred at the end life of this building (42) and may have significance related to this event - clearing out of house - scouring episode.
So positioning of both these features F1508 and F1509 suggests an elaboration of these platforms, and possibly therefore that this building had an area of 'ritual' or even that the building had a 'ritual' or 'shrine' status. However it is also possible that many houses at this level had a similar mix of ritual space within the domestic.

Stratigraphicallt I would place it under the floors 10243 (it physically covers the cut and its fill) but with the reserve that the floors were disturbed by later i/ subsequent nterference, so not in situ. Therefore the cut would have come from higher in the sequence.

June 2010 - redesignated from Sp.237 to Sp.1002 because Floors (10243) were very close to the surface, eroded and not floor like, rather like spread of powdery white plaster erosion, therefore considered very dubious + take in account DGB comments above.  F.1556 therefore allocated to post chalco.

Small pedestal or plith constructed against engagaed pillar F.1496. The top two plasttered layers were decorated with a stripe of red paint around the base of the engaged pillar (see sketch on feature sheet). In the latest phase (13674) there are also traces of red paint  along the southern edge of the pedestal suggestin it may originally have been completely red around the sides.
During an earlier phase both the pedestal and platform F1662 were the same structure and extended a further 18cm out into the room (see sketch sheet 2) and were cut back, perhaps to create more space for the oven.
The small pedestal remaining was then continually added to as it became worn and as more floors were added to both platform F1666 and central floor area F1663.

From Archive Report 2008:
The northern end of platform F.1662 was raised slightly, forming a small bench, F.1653,  which was plastered with (17481). Both platform and bench were sealed by mid brown make  up (17474) and repeatedly re-plastered with white clay plaster (17473), (17472), (17424),  (17405) and (17401). This constant re-plastering of F.1662 and F.1653 continues throughout  the buildings use,

Fully excavated sept 2008. SF
This feature has been described as a small plinth but at its construction inception appears to be more like a bench. Formed of a single, re used brick (17915) it was rendered in  mortar (17901), similar to the mortar packing (17927) around post F.1496 and then successivly plastered.

Numerous associated floors and surfaces, but not listed in detail.

Discussion:
Southern wall of building 1, appears to be a single phase construction (phase 1) which was not altered or modified apart from the insertion of F39 in the eastern part [wall 6].
the three different types of mudbrick were probably laid in rapid succession.

Late on in the season it was discovered that there was also a fourth course (3830) / (3831) which must have been in a cut (3871)"^^xsd:string ;

AK 24.07.2012 - excavation
The recognized gap in the courses of the bricks within wall [ F.445] appeared to be a niche rather than the previously assumed crawl-hole. It was cut in the mentioned wall truncating also the inter-wall infill u 20212. Therefore it may be stated that the niche F.454 was later than wall F445 as well as the accumulated deposit between the walls [F.445 and 7052]."^^xsd:string ;

Wall plastered with white plaster.
Post-depositional features include two animal holes.

The wall appears to continue downwards, and is overlain by a presumed fill layer (18354) before a younger wall 5058 was built on top. Along with F.3313 and 3314, the wall delimits space 310 . Leaving just the southern side oped due to the limit of excavation. These latter features (3312, 3313, 3314) thereby appear to constitute an earlier phase of construction around the space than later features 3301/ 3302/ 5058/ 2408/ 2427. 

Investigations should be continued next season by extending the trench south - to attempt to follow the wall south - and then removing the more recent construction phase before continuing excavation downwards to identify the base of the wall and therefore identify features/ units contemporary with the walls construction."^^xsd:string ;

The wall was heavily disturbed by roots and animals and its upper courses of bricks were removed within an arbitrary layer (30400). The uncovered section and plan of the lower part of the wall made the following observations possible.
The northern wall of the building seem to be a half-brick thick wall. However, it is possible that the feature was originally a one-brick or even one-and-a-half-brick thick wall that was either truncated by the foundation trench of building A.III.2 or continues in the southern part of the trench under a layer of white pebbles. 
The wall is situated next to the southern wall of, what seems to be, later building A.III.2, with an ashy infill layer, about 6-10 cm wide, separating the two building structures. The northern face of the wall of A.III.3 is covered with a layer that seem to have the same physical characteristics as the mortar. This might be mortar layer indeed or an external plaster layer.  
The western wall of the building seem to be one-brick thick wall, but once again alternative interpretations are possible. The two examined courses of bricks were not bonded, which may suggest that the walls constitute separate buildings. However, it is also possible that they made up a one-and-a-half-brick thick wall that could be fully recorded after extending the trench and excavating two top courses of bricks. 
The both mentioned walls are made up of mid brown - light orange mud bricks with more or less equal silt and sand content. The difference between the bricks and the mortar is clear, the later having light/mid-grey colour and including aggregates and organic material."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "2012:
Only part of the feature was exposed and excavated. The feature is a light yellow brick wall, 3 brick rows thick with light grey mortar in between the bricks. 
Excavated in order to determine the relation between it and wall 3623. Thought to be a younger wall, built alongside the N face of the  F.3623. Turned up to be in between the uppermost and lower rows of bricks of the latter. The part of the feature truncating the F.3623 Left in situ.
We think that it may be evidence of reconstruction and repairs done during functioning of  Building 108.

Further excavation in 2013 by a. klimowicz:

Feature 3624 (u.20416-bricks, u.20415-mortar) together with F.3623  had been assigned as the southern walls of Space 489. Due to the exploration strategy (established in 2012), excavations embraced only eastern part of the mentioned space leaving section/profile through midden deposits. In the course of the decision, arbitrary Western limit of the trench was set up, along the Grid line: E-1044,00. Consequently, work conducted in 2013 embraced only eastern fragment of the feature. The wall 3624 was erected after preparing foundation cut in the midden. However, foot of the feature did not reached the bottom of the soft dumping deposit, but stood directly on the midden at the height of 1012,44 m A.S.L. The construction of wall in such circumstances aimed to create stable foundation and proper surface to set on its base the factual structure of B.108. It is clear that in spite of an overlap/shift between the southern walls (F.3623 and 3624) in central part of the Sp.489 they obviously represent one constructional episode."^^xsd:string ;

It is in extremely poor conservation condition, which is why the ~50 cm exposed at the end of the 2012 season were removed. The extant portion of the wall is still visible in plan. No mortar is distinguishable from the mud brick, likely due to the burned condition of the wall.

Updated 3/8/2013: Much more of this wall was revealed, including its relationshipt to the two E bins in sp. 493. All of the bricks continue to be bright pink, crumbly, and rock hard. The wall dives back to the E in its S extent, possible as some sort of feature. The wall has been burrowed into extensively."^^xsd:string ;

It goes 30cm deeper than plaster (13726). Both plaster layers do not reach the bottom of the walls. The wall is made from two rows of mudbrick.

JMR 27.8.2009:When further excavating the room fill in space 310 we noticed that F.2427 had already been undercut last year. Under it there is a layer of fill (18355) and underneath an older wall (3314) with roughly the same orientation and belonging to an older phase of space 310.
This sheet was opened in order to document final dimensions of F.2427.

JMR 22.8.2010: F.2427 forms the eastern border of Sp. 310 - it is sitting on top of F. 3314, a wall forming the border of an earlier space (453) under Sp. 310. 2422 might be binding into 2408, as brick layers in this part seem stacked - see 10/532.
  2427 consists of very dark grey brick, yellow mortar, it is plastered over on its western face (Sp. 310, 454). Single bricks are discernible in plan, one measures ca. 75+35 cm. Southern extension cuts side trench.
  East of Sp.454 badly truncated by pit F.3331 and another disturbance (15161).
  Upper 30-40 cm of wall removed in 2010 to check stratigraphy and for stability of truncated parts.

JMR 14.8.2011
After the 2011 season, F.2427 and Building 106 were visible in full outlines. F.2427 is sitting on older walls F.3314 and F.3357. In the south, the upper part of the wall was badly disturbed by late pits and only preserved 15cm high. NS 6.84m, EW 0.84m, height 0.24m in the south, 0.15m in the north.

It has a portion of a roof finial lying along the top of the exposed section. Two mini-walls jut out from it to the North, the function of which is unclear. Some sections of plaster remain, suggesting the entire wall (and its mini-extensions) were completely plastered when this wall was built. It is unclear whether this is an exterior or interior wall of building 120, as erosion has destroyed many architectural remains to the W and S. In excavating this wall, we found about 7 roof finials, stacked in perpendicular-oriented layers within the wall. The bricks were quite crumbled and eroded, which made finding the S extent of the wall extremely difficult. In the end, it seemed to protrude into the S edge of the trench. We also realized that this wall was actually built on top of the floor makeup layer u. 30273. This means that f.7150 likely represents a later, interior wall that was constructed rather opportunistically, out of less-than-optimal materials. In finding the W extent of the wall, we realized the cut [30299] proceeded unpredictably into Neolithic mud-brick material and that f.7150 was actually built in/on top of an earlier oven. Its bricks were packed inside and around this oven, then packed as well into the jagged cut. This wall seems like quite an afterthought in the history of this building, judging by its construction materials and techniques."^^xsd:string ;

The wall (F.7149) is made of grey bricks and orange mortar just like its bonded counterparts: F.7125, F.7126, F.3679.

The fill of the cut consisted of heterogeneous material, also remains from the oven area: charcoal, baked clay, ash, plant remains, gypsum, etc. In the sides of the cut one can see that the cache was inserted into layers of of floors and packings in the kitchen.
The floors which covered this feature layer were very damaged because of the vicinity of fire installations. At the bottom of the cut a flint blade was found (x1 in unit #8393). In the south edge of the cut there is an animal hole.

  c:description "Description:
This feature number has been given to 4 walls that define space 230. Bricks are a reddish brown sediment surrounded by layers of light to mid-grey mortar. The walls are uniformly 0.23-0.25m in width and appear to cut into earlier walls on the north and south sides. The mud bricks are uniform in color and vary only slightly in dimension (length from 0.70 - 0.95m). The eastern wall is shorter than the western wall due to post depositional erosion. As a result the North and South walls are sloped. Mortar is clearly visible between each brick and is a consistent thickness of approximately 3 cm. There seems to be an extraneous brick attached to the SE corner of the walls (cf. 04/705). Walls are in good condition, w/out plaster, and clearly stop at al plaster layer (as in seen in the western wall). Feature 1601 may cut into the original wall in the western corner. 

Discussion: NO NO NO (SF 07/07/10)
The feature appears to be in phase with the southern part of Sp. 229 and appears to be later than the northern part of Sp.229. The base of the wall is clearly marked by a plaster layer visible on the western wall - this may be a continuation of the plaster clump in the SE corner of Sp. 229. This is probably the remnants of a floor. The walls clearly cut into and sit on older walls (differentiated by a browner color and plaster lining as well as less visible brick lines) that are possibly contemporary with the northern part of Sp.229. The burial cut (F.1601) may truncate the western wall, although indications are sketchy at best."^^xsd:string ;

For the skull and horn description see unit sheet 11963.

Preserved and conserved in situ for display.

From Archive Report 2005 :

F.2175 is the bull head with horns set into a niche in the western wall to the north of bench F.2021 (Fig. 40). This emplacement was set approximately 0.2m above the platform (F.2174) surface. The state of preservation of the feature was relatively good, despite the obvious exposure to the fire. It was not uniformly heat affected it and so the tips of both horns were calcined and white, while the bases of both the right and left horn-cores appear to have been subjected to a mixture of high and low temperatures, being grey and white, calcined as well as carbonated.

The frontal of the cranium was fire blackened. The skull and horns were set in a low bench in a semicircular niche cut into wall F.2106, it was therefore clearly not freestanding and only horns and snout protruded. It appears that the nasal area was transformed by sectioning the snout, prior to the installation of the feature into the wall. The tip of the snout was very close to the floor, almost making contact with it. The fact that the skull was fixed into the wall with plaster layers up against it and behind the eye sockets, provided great stability to the entire feature, and therefore it survived in situ despite the collapse of walls an roof. It must be noted that the skull and horns were not plastered in this case unlike many bucrania excavated in the 1960s. A few centimeters north of the niche that accommodated the bull’s head were
found a pair of goat horns, placed on the floor and against the wall.

Within the burnt debris above the installation F.2175, a large number of horns was found together with another very fragmentary bull skull but none of these appeared to have been in their original location, being placed on top of the room fill (10286) (Fig. 41). The question of how and why this pile of horns existed above the intact installation will be discussed in depth further on but it is possible that they existed as installations elsewhere in the room prior to the fire, which were gathered post fire, perhaps when Building 51 was under construction, and placed / protected/ preserved in this location as a significant deposition?

Removed 03.07.13 by conservation team. At the same time, the fill (U. 20649) was removed. On a depth of c. 0,1 m two x-finds were found: a piece of antler (X1) and a flint blade (X2).

From archive report, 2006:
Platform 2096
Removal of the upper plaster surface (13379) revealed ash dump, (14012), and clay levelling deposit, (14037), both of which were removed. As the ash deposit was so discrete and lay directly under platform conforming to its limits, it can only be assumed this ‘midden-like’ deposit had been located elsewhere and brought in as make-up material rather than being a primary deposit. The plaster make-up of small ‘bench’ F.2098 also lay above ash deposit (14012), except for a small circular area lying directly beneath the ‘bench’. This ‘clear’ area contained cluster (14009) with stones, crystal fragments and a bone point, its nature suggesting the cluster might have been contained within a bag and deposited at the same time as ashy material (14012)."^^xsd:string ;

'Late' burial truncated by the Western cut of building 41 (Cut 12632 - F1218)
Discussion
Feature 1475 is a burial, presumably late (although no clear dating evidence was recovered). It certainly predates the construction of Building 41 as it is truncated to the west by 12632 - the western foundation cut of B41 - the large Byzantine structure.

The skeleton 12651 was in fairly good condition, extended, lying on its right side and facing south.

There were no associated grave goods.

Patchy plaster was found on both the eastern and western faces of the wall; (13478) and (13485), both of which continued onto S wall F2216.

Discussion
 Although described as a wall, it is possible this feature could be the remnants of a bench. The heavy truncation down to one course makes it difficult to say. It is only three bricks long so pos a bench, but N side is unplastered. On its east side is platform F2226, so potential bench location maybe?
 The significant deposits (13490)+(13491) may point to this being a special structure, more likely a bench than a wall.
It is also one of the earliest features in the building and may have just been a way to divide up the internal space.
 At its most basic, ie three bricks, it's a wall, but I feel it's more likely to be a bench.

The thin wall stones to sit on the layer part of the midden above (5460).  After the midden had begun to be created against the (?) edge of wall F829, (which runs N-S) a decision was made to build a thin wall on top of a part of it.

Northern part of wall appears vague in section and suspect that at this point the wall ends and meets ande E/W wall which heads west into section.

DISCUSSION
N/S wall, probably part of a building, return at Ne end suggest this is the eastern external wall of a structure. Two brick types and a single mortar suggests the buildingers were not too concerned about having identical materials in the construction.

Wall F 2841is build close (parallel) to F 2840 wall, but a gap exists between them. I would suggest that F 2841 is later than F2840.

As the structure to which F2840 belongs goes out of use F 2841 is constructed. Room fill (15641) is dumped into the space to the north of F 2840 and butts up against F 2841. There is no evidence that F2841 is in a cut and why dig down 7 courses plus to build a wall.

They can't be contemporary, as plaster (15646) on N face of F2480 lips round NW corner into tiny gap between walls and presumably, originally down W face as well. This is also the reason why F2480 can't be later than F2481."^^xsd:string ;

From Archive Report 2007:

To the west of wall F.2832 wall F.2831, aligned in a north-south orientation, was set on to the inclined west facing wall of F.2835 but also cut in to midden (15437). So, whilst being physically above wall F.2835 was stratigraphically above midden (15437). F.2831 consisted of foundation cut (15601). The lowest 3 courses of bricks (15450) and corresponding mortar (15451) were very different in consistency to the top four courses, which comprised of mudbricks (15486) and mortar (15487). It seems that the wall was trench built and so there was no backfill observed in the cut (which was identified in section, not in plan). It is likely that the top four courses represent a rebuild but until larger scale excavation is undertaken in this area one feature number was allocated to the wall as a whole, for the sake of simplicity. The lowest mudbricks (15450) measured 0.6m x 0.40m x 60mm, consisting of firm light yellowish brown sandy silt and the corresponding mortar (15451) measured up to 2mm thick and consisted of firm dark greyish brown clayey silt. It is important to note here that (15450) and (15451) were the same as the mudbrick and mortar in slumped wall F.2835. The mudbricks in the top four course of wall F.2831 were very different to the lower ones and were made from firm mid brownish grey sandy silt and although their length and width were the same as (15050) they were thicker at up to c.0.10m.

22/8/2010. JMR: Wall F. 2424 forms the eastern border of Sp. 342. It consists of very firm, dark grey brick and yellow mortar, at least 2 mortar lines and 6 brick layers (2010 season). During the 2010 season, 2424 was cut into by several cm from the east - construction nicely visible. See photos. Bricks visible in plan and section.
  Upper part (ca. 30 cm) removed in 2010 for reasons of safety - process documented in photos. Separated from 5058 by a 4-5 cm gap, relations to other features not checked this year. Dimensions unclear as well, as this part of the trench remained backfilled during season.

18 courses of grayish bricks and brown mortar.  Visible thick plaster line on the south face indicates that this is proabably a truncated north wall.

This wall is south of wall F.2532 but no clear relationship between the two walls is present

(added July 2012):

some microstrata observations are noted in the unit sheets but some general  ponts about F2533 are as follows (please note that full excavtion of the wall has not yet occurred, only partial excavtion):

1.regular  courses of brick and mortar occur excpet around the groove/niche at which point the layers become more silty and diffuse and regular courses and bricks became hard to discern. Distinct courses picked up again below the groove

2. The  interior of the wall has been plastered and replastered at least 10-15 times, but not the exterior (the excavation did not reach the lower parts of the wall which may contain pigment).

3. The groove has probably not held an architectually bearing function but might still have worked as a beam for hanging textiles. 

4. The centrally placed pillar has had a moulded top (F8432) which migh indicate that it had some kind of bearing function.

5. There is no physical connection to F2532, a wall belonging to B86 further in the north, due to a fill layer which makes it difficult to establish a statographic matrix at this moment."^^xsd:string ;

From Archive 2008:
In the north western corner of the building, set into platform F.4008, plaster basin F.4010 consisted of several phases of use. The earliest basin, (16645), measured 0.45m by 0.40m and had an sub-rectangular grinding stone set in thin layer of mid brown silty clay’ (16673)’ on its the southern side. This was sealed a second basin constructed of grey brown sandy silt (16644) and plaster (16643). This was in turn sealed by brown clay silt (14485), possibly associated with a later, truncated phase of use. A series of dirty, ash rich, floors (16670) to the south of F.4010 appear to be associated with the activities conducted in this part of the building. Basin F.4010 was sealed by a mixed dump of mudbrick and building material (14482), intended to raise the level of the platform."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "This feature was recognized under u.20907, a plaster collapse from F3688. It was interpreted as a basin initially because of its size and sloping shape. It contained more units than initially thought, and has had a complicated life-history with phasing and interference. It was covered by a fill, u.20925, which was compound and represents the final abandonment of this feature. 

Constructionwise, it seems as the inhabitants, when they decided that they wanted this structure to be adjoined to F.3688 (by then perhaps a center piece), they made small cuts in the floor and laid a levelling element, probably also to elevate the feature, in order to cover the previous cut F.7140 and also because the floors were slightly uneven. Then they laid the plaster wall and the plaster floor, which in the first phase was covering a quite big area (the whole extent of the feature).

For some reason, the people wanted to change the feature at some point. That is when they laid a grey base and lining (reused plaster?) in the southern side of it, to reduce its size. When this reduction was made they cut it for the burial of a neonate individual (F.7134). I think this is also when they cut the eastern end for the deposition of ground stone tools. In other words this reduction and change of form in this feature was apparently constricted and surrounded by ritual and symbolic actions. The grey base was then sealed furthermore with a floor (u.20986), showing only its lining under u.20925. Anyway, once changed this is the form of the basin until it was finally closed with u.20925.

This is a complicated feature, and it is hard to grasp its function. Presumably it can be seen as contemporary with the latest hearth (F.3692) opposite it (?). No special finds were found that could speak of use; it was quite clean. Perhaps it was made for storage of some sort, and perhaps it had to do also with the cut below (F.7140). Perhaps this is a reorganization and formalisation of that functional unit, just as we see in the hearth sequencing in the other side of the space, where they remade and formalised the heart hconstruction, especially in the latest phase."^^xsd:string ;

This feature is a bench extending from the eastern wall (f4088) of building 97, space 365, from a visible scar in the wall. Excavating this feature revealed mud-bricks and plaster mortar on the east end of this bench, constituting an addition to its original, more level structure-- although it should be noted that even at the earliest plastering, a small, 2 cm tall step is present at the eastern end. The plaster mortar, furthermore, was at one point shaped to provide support for a round mud-brick pillar, around which the rectangular addition was built.
The northern face of the bench and the top face, toward the eastern end, show in-situ red-painted plaster, suggesting that this bench was partially or completely painted red at one phase in its use-life."^^xsd:string ;

The bench was narrow and slim, however, the exact shape and extent of the bench especially in its W part is difficult to determine. The bench was surrounded by construction material debris that might have been originally from the bench itself as the W part of it was truncated or destroyed. At least 9 horncorns (from which 2 together with the skull) belong to wild sheep males were associated with the bench sticking out on its both sides. The E part of the bench was badly truncated by animal burrows, however its extent in this part is clear. On the N edge of the bench a layer, dark brown and friable, possibly a repair patch or part of later intrusion (the ridge F7315), was found. The plaster U20673 was covering this patch making its relation to the bench unclear.
Directly on top of the bench a ridge/partition wall was constructed  while erecting the high platform F2177 in order to create the compartment to contain the infill U20657.

Platform F2378 was elevated slightly with a brick rubble core (14727) which also formed the core of an additional bench F.2379 at its southern limits, effectively reducing the size of the platform on its N-S axis by 30cm the width of the new bench.

Next in its development the bench alone seems to have been plastered by (14733) though this seems unlikely such that the plaster on the platform was either eroded or so fragmentary it was removed during excavation with the later surface. Prior to the next plastering of both bench and platform the benches height was elevated slightly by 2-4 cm with a thin layer of brick crush (14732) and an off white marl plaster
(14733) applied to the bench alone. The two features then as with the platform to the north were covered with a sequence of make up layers and plaster surfaces (14721), (14719), (14684) & repair (14686), a very remnant floor (14646) lipped up to the platform and partially covered the bench and finally the whole bench and platform were covered by a thick layer (2-4 cm) of fine white plaster (14630).

The platform and bench combination against the eastern wall was mirrored exactly in Building 60 above excavated in 2006, with the exception of the nine burials contained within the later buildings platform."^^xsd:string ;

The NW bin is the largest and may initially have had a belled out base but collapse has removed the SE corner. It is possible that there was an opening in the front otherwise it would have been impossible to gain acess to the grain. Initally it was thought that a large stone may have blocked the opening but it now appears that the large stone may have been put inside the Sw corner of the NE bin possibly to help provide support. The opening to the NE bin may have been just above this stone  on the SW corner of the bin. On the south side of the belled out NE bin is a third smaller circular bin built as part of the same structure and forming a small, straight sided bin. One possibility for the grain in front of the bins is that it spilled from the collapse of the bin and was preserved under the collapse of the bin clay whereas the contents of the bins themselves suffered compustion in the fire."^^xsd:string ;

The infill was full of ash and pieces of burnt clay. Charcoal was common in the lower half of the infill. A large lump of charred mustard seeds was found at the north wall. The seeds were wrapped in something before burning, as the lump was flat and oval in shape, as if they were keept in a wrap of skin. Th elump was 26 cm long, 9 ch wide and 5 cm thick. It was collected as X2 of the infill.
The stratigraphic relations of the bin:
It was built on the lower layers of floor u 20491, but the upper layers go up against the walls, which means the floor and the bin was contemporary.
The walls of the bin was build against the northern wall of sp 95, F1022. The plaster of F1022 is found behind the Eastern part of the bin wall. 
And it seems that the E wall of bin F3650 is just above the truncated W wall of bin F3649.
Construction of the bin:
It looks as if they put long rolls of wet clay on the floor where they wanted the bin and then place already made and dry walls by pushing them down into the wet clay. Then they palced supporting clay on the junction between floor and bin wall on the outside - smoothing it out on the floor and lower part of bin walls. See photos 4973 and 4974 and profile on sketch. The walls are ca 3 cm thick under the supporting clay that make the base of the walls look thicker."^^xsd:string ;

The fill in it was removed carefully, with 3Dmodelling all the way (layer by layer) to really investigate the finds in it. Three horn cores were placed on top of each other; the first two cattle and the third sheep (wild maybe). Except for these finds (also some ground stones, stone bead) it was more of an infill material. The bin was probably filled during the time when the building was closed. The question is whether the horn cores were part of a filling sequence or if they were part of a usage phase of bin feature. That they were \"floating\" and that other artefacts also were found might speak for the former even if post depositional processes can make attached stuff loose.

The excavation of this feature stopped after removing fill u.20924, because we reached a good level (a bin floor) and nicely preserved walls. Next year (2014) will tell more of phasing of the bin as well as the bin floor's characteristics; even if one sample was taken for phytoliths.

The fact that it is rectangular in shape, with a seemingly empty space in the middgle led to its initial interpretation as a bin. However, when excavating the interior (as shown on the section drawing 10/528) a layer of plaster (ca. 1-2 cm thick) appeared to block it, making the storage function an unlikely interpretation.
 In terms of its construction materials, the main rectangular outer body of the feature was made of mudbricks, whereas the inside, apart from the aforementioned plaster, contained some chuncks of dark yellow clay and a complex stratigraphy of dark reddish brown and dark brown silt, as well as charcoal inclusions.
  Its connection to the floor (U.15170) to its W and E is unclear, since most of the area surrounding the feature has been disturbed by animal burrows. Nevertheless, it could be argued that the floor might be later than the installation, since at one point on the western side of the installation the plaster floor and the feature are connected, the plaster floor crawling onto the feature.

This is why we have called it a bin-- it seems designed and used for storage, although of course it does not appear like the storage bins in the Neolithic houses. Or, for that matter, anything else really. It is built on top of both bins f.7151 and f.7152, which are similar in appearance although their contents were not similarly preserved.

On top of it, plaster had collapsed from the bin walls as well as the S wall probably. Beneath this plaster collapse the layer was the original fill of the feature as well as floor. However, it was hard to recognize, why a part of the underlying floor levels were also removed, that is, floors from the whole house.

This small bin feature was seemingly built on floor level u.30132 which was below u.20909 and u.30113. This makes it one of the later features built in this house, i.e. one of the features with shortest continuity. In the plaster collapse, a nice obsidian piece was found, but otherwise there is not much else telling of the bin's function specifically. It is however placed in a peculiar way very close to F7141 and the threshold area. It is also nice and symmetrical in its shape. Perhaps these two characteristics can be leading in the interpretation of this feature."^^xsd:string ;

The disturbed remains of a child aged 4-6 years at the time of death were discovered immediately below an adult female (16465). Like the adult skeleton, the juvenile skeleton was in poor condition. Buried on its left side, the body was tightly flexed at the hips and knees. The head was to the west and the feet to the east. The head, mandible, and several other bony elements were missing entirely. Black staining was observed on several bones. The grave cut was visible at the eastern and southern edges of the cut. Animal and root disturbance was extensive in the area of the skeleton."^^xsd:string ;

The heavy root action indicares that it has been close to the surface of the mound. The skull of skeleton 17536 was missing and due to the position of the skeleton it would have been higher than the surface as is today, indicating horizontal truncation. 

There were two adults, two neonates, and two juveniles present. The two adults were complete barring a couple of missing/dis-articulated bones. The rest were all semi-articulated. 

The cut could not be fully excavated due to the presence of the walkway to the south. However, there may be a relationship to the two burials to the south F3088 and F3089. Further investigation should be carried out to see if the cut extends to the West."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Late Roman/Byzantine tomb cut into chalco. Layers, Bg. 25. It consisted of a stone-lined tomb containing a wooden coffin holding the skeleton of a woman aged over 25 with 2 grave-goods (a wooden spindle & a CU alloy ring with seal-stone). The whole was very impressive. The upper part of the wall was removed early before it was understood properly (see discussion). The wall stretched along most of the south, all of the west, & 3/4 of the north sides of the grave, & possiby originally all round tho' no robbed cut noted. Stones also covered the base, w. a single stone at W for the head. All very impressive. Upper courses may have been disturbed by later ploughing & removed.

Large tomb-wall, huge cut containing substantial stone wall/lining (F 710), on 3 sides. Unfortunatley, part of the upper wall was removed early. This is because there were 2 options - in the absence of any signs of grave cut higher up, one possibility was that the grave was shallow but surrounded by a stone wall (possibly once roofed): the other was that the cut was simply not visible. Enquiry of those working immediately N of the wall elicited the information that the stones did not continue down. Thus I opted for the first possibility, wthout checking for stones myself - a mistake. The stones did in fact continue down for several courses & cover the base. Initially we decided not to draw a proper elevation, so just did a sketch of the south-facing N-wall (the most substantial of the 3 walls). Therefore the elevation I finally drew does not include the upper 2 or 3 courses, and the photos are of either the upper or the lower walls, not of the complete tomb. I won't make that mistake again - or I hope not anyway."^^xsd:string ;

F.3010, contained a large quantity of disarticulated and semi-articulated human bone (Figure 18). The grave

The primary burials, in the base of the grave cut consisted of a crouched adult burial (16132). This skeleton was lying on its left side with black bead bracelets on both wrists 16132.X1, 16132.X2, 16132.X4) and a single piece of obsidian 16132.X3. A second skeleton (16131) was an infant burial, again with bracelets on both wrists 16131.X1, 16131.X2, 16131.X3, 16131.X4. The skeleton was on its back with the left hand placed on the pelvis and both legs bent at the knee. A third articulated skeleton (16308) was tightly flexed and placed in the grave on its back. Several plaster beads (16308.X1) were recovered from around the left proximal tibia and a bone spatula with blue pigment 16308.X2 was found directly to the north of the skeleton"^^xsd:string ;

At some subsequent time those bricks were chopped away at, and a load of human bones were dumped in the eastern half of the trench. Bones from all over the body were found, but none of the long-bones; even a heavily fragmented skull was present. 

No primary burial was ever found - not a single bone appeared in the western half of the 'covered area', suggesting that no body was ever present there. This suggests the space was never actually intended as a burial, although subsequently some human bones were dumped there. At some point following the original infilling of the cut, a secondary truncation was made, possibly at the same time as the mixed charnel deposit was dumped, cutting away at the mud-bricks covering the grave and creating the cut seen today. No cut around the mudbricks was visible, suggesting they were simply laid at surface level, and not buried or sunk into the ground in any way. 

Massive truncation of the feature by animal burrows had occurred, particularly in the walls.

The following describes the complications within this feature in extent. From Human Remains Archive Report, 2007: 

Burial F.2604 was a single primary inhumation that had been disturbed. Further analysis of the bones showed that there were in fact the remains of two individuals, a female and a male, both of which were disturbed. Some parts of their bodies were taken away and the rest was arranged to look like one flexed body.

A complete right leg and foot, intact but disarticulated from its skeleton, was found in articulation with its hip bone. A complete left leg and foot from another individual, intact and but disarticulated from its skeleton, was also found. Finally, an articulated hand was found near the foot of Sk.14507.b2 which possibly belonged to this person. Few other parts of this individual were found in situ. 

Sk.14507.b1, the adult male, was buried earlier than Sk.14507.b2, the adult female. The interment of the female disturbed the male. Only some parts of the body of 14507.b1 were found, including the skull, right arm, left lower arm, left leg, left hipbone, sacrum and some upper left ribs. The rest of the body was removed from this location. 

An interesting aspect of the feature is that two bodies were assembled to look like one individual. A similar case where semi-articulated elements were deliberately placed into the grave in a simulated flexed position with a second individual was found in Building 60 from the 4040 Area (F.2225, Sk. (13133); see 2006 archive report)."^^xsd:string ;

A sherd of pottery in the top of the fill and a small rectangular disturbance with same fill as Byzantine burials (a shovel mark?) show that this burial has been close to the surface. 
The buried child, approx. 4-6 years according to Human bones lab persons, was placed with the head to the W and its back to the N and the pulled up feet to the E. It seems to be laying on the right side with knees pulled upp towards torso and the arms may have been wraped around the legs. The bones of the lower legs were separated from the rest of the body, perhaps by some of the above mentioned disturbances. When discovered I first thought they were part of a second person, but this seems unlikely. 
The fill in the burial was massive, but had lumps of hard brick material in it. Much charcoal and a few animal (?) bones were found in the fill, as well as some small pieces of obsidian and shell. Nothing that may be interpreted as gravegoods.

Perhaps the bricks were placed on top as the last thing in the burial, as they were visible from the top.
The body was placed in a supine position. The head was missing, other than that, much of the body was preserved, even though in fragile state.
The western part of the burial was disturbed by animal burrowing. It is possible that someone had dug into the burial fill at some point and retrieved the head of the dead body. This 'head retrieval pit' left a softer material for an animal to burrow in, which may explain the extent of disturbance in that area of the burial. 
No skull fragment were found in the disturbed area, which indicates that the head was gone by the time the animal disturbed the area. 
However, the teeth that were found near the ribs shows that tha head has been present (the body was not buried decapitated), and it shows that the head had been in the ground long enough fot the teeth to come loose, but was in good condition as it did not break at all, as there are no skull fragments at all. Probably a while after the burial, but not very long after. 
However, the animal may have displaced some hand bone on the left side, see plan 12/315. According to Josh the left side of the skeleton was less preserved than the right one. The animal borrowing was frequent at the left side of the body, along the north wall of the burial.
I SW corner a horn core was found. It is stuck into the side and bottom of the cut. The Byzantine people digging the burial may have cut into it. It probably belongs to something (neolithic?) below the burial. It was left in there for now."^^xsd:string ;

This later burial held an adult. The burial cut contained a mud brick lining that was placed above the individual. This formed a false bottom, perhaps to protect the burial from robbery.

The individual was most likely placed with a coffin as iron nails were also uncovered. 

An interesting aspect of the buriall was the location of the obsidian point (19498. x1) that was placed above the mud brick lining; right on top of the chest of the individual. Its been suggested that the this point was found during the lifetime of the person who was buried and left in their grave as a token.

Skeleton: An asult who was buried on his/her left side with the head in the west and facing north. Straight arms, legs unarticulated.  Damaged by later burials, but the upper part of the body in a good condition: tibia + femur possibly on north edge (of U20420).
Grave infill: Similar to the surrounding material and disturbed, therefore hard to distinguish from the surrounding material. The same problem goes for the entire grave cluster: Many burials, all individuals in separate cuts; and similar infills that have been dug up again and reused, make it hard to define the grave edges in terms of cut lines plus infill differences. The positions of the skeletons and disarticulated elements, though, give a good picture of cuts and stratigraphy.

Primarly burial, disturbed by later burials. No signs of wrapping, binding, no grave goods.
19472 is one of only two adults in the Space 40 grave cluster although perhaps a young adult. The legs are disturbed and unarticulated, which they would not have been if 19472 was buried in an extended position. Therefore, it seems that 19472 was buried in the same crouched position as the other skeletons in the Space 40 cluster.

Inside was the disturbed skeleton of a child, mixed with pot sherds and some animal bone. There was an animal burrow in the base of the grave.

This grave appears earlier than 2454 to the East as the latter walls seem deliberatly thin as the western side so as not to cut this grave. Walls of this grave and stone capping are in place - only the grave fill (13864) seems disturbed due to animal activity. The skull of the child was scattered in three places in the fill - extreme east, north central and central - giving a sense of the level of disturbance in the fill. No obvious grave goods seem to have been deposited - sherds and obsidian in fill just look like fill matter rather than deliberate depositions. \"Headstone\" perhaps should be \"footstone\" given the usual orientation of skull to West in this area.

  c:description "The feature was found when straightening a section for F 3688, a semi-wall in B.102. The soil around the skeleton was quite loose, why almost half of the skeleton and soil fell down which immediatly were sampled. The bones were brought to the human remains lab. When removing the section bulk the skeleton was found directly under U20481, room fill. After exposing Sk.20609, the specialist osteologists further exposed and lifted the remains, and photographed for 2D ortho. 

The feature consists of one skeleton of an infant (baby), and an arbitrary layer, which was soil associated with the baby. No cut was discovered during excavation. The room fill was stratigraphically above SK 20609, and soil surrounding the remains were similar to that, but looser and more homogeneous. It was assigned as arbitrary, because no obvious fill was observed. However the possibility of it should not be neglected, especially concerning the skeleton being placed (flexed etc.), primary and undisturbed. Beneath the feature is an ashy layer containing bovine horn core and human cranial fragments. The feature's location is in an entrance or opening between S17 and S18.

For this feature intepretation in field has been made from the most certain and visible, namely the skeleton, which were found  in a perhaps flexed position facing west, with extended cranial position, by the specialist team in the field intepreted as undisturbed. The main disturbance was made while straightening a section for presumable continuation (in 2012) of F3688, which turned out to be room fill (U20481). Hence the extremities of lower body (and upper?) are missing.

The position and orientation of the baby skeleton were similar to a formal burial. Soil associated with it were assigned a fill, however this is an arbitrary, i.e. reconstructed afterwards, layer. It is still possible that the placement of the body was directly on the floor level/ashy deposit, forming a deposition on the ground, probably threshold-associated, not cut into something. In this sense a deliberate \"burial\" without a cut is possible, and could be connected with the closing of the house, given its connection to the later room fill (20481)."^^xsd:string ;

  c:description "Pit F.3331 is a late event compared to all the other features in this area. Thus far, it is unclear as to the full dimensions and southern extent of the pit, as there was no time left to go deeper or to extend to the south again. The pit has contained both Chalcolithic pottery and obsidian, and late ceramic (burial) tiles and flat (burial) rock. There were clusters of human skeletal remeins scattered and fragmented throughout the upper layers 15195 and 15179, but there was the highest concentration in 15195 with some neonate remains and one adult. This pit was probably dug directly through a late Byzantine burial near the surface, and down through the Chalcolthic context architecture and room fill artefacts - and then after the pit was cut it was refilled with all the material mixed. Why was the pit dug? It is not clear yet, we may have more answers once the Feature is further defined. A burial looting event is a possibility, or even another attempt to create a burial pit for someone else - until they realised they had already dug through an earlier burial this pit also cut through the lower limbs of burial F.3318, meaning 3318 was an earlier event than this pit. The pit is bell shaped, undercutting the buttresses F.3301 and 3302, and 2427 along with U.15176.

A burial pit is located beneath eastern, central platform (F. 3508) of Space 370. Infill was homogenous and in it's upper part some loose bones has been recorded. At the bottom of the pit human, articulated bones has been exposed. Only the upper part of the adult individual has been found. Skull, cervical vertebrae, lumbar vertabrae, legs and pelvis were not present. Skeleton was oriented west - east with hands flexed toward upper body. Cut of the pit is regular and ovoid in shape, it's basal boundar is flat and ealier burial cuts are visible within it. It was the latest burial in space 370.

Primarly deposition, disturbed by later burials. Badly disturbed, only skull, mandible, cervical vertibrae and possibly one femur present at first sight. Quite close to the skull were two pointed bone tools (X1 and X2 of 20400), which seemed to be deliberately deposited next to each other and oriented in the same way. The exact position of the bone tools is not known, though. See unit sheet 20400.
One completely articulated leg was found with its prox femur close to the chin of 19499. The cervical vertibrae of 19499 were still in articulation, which indicates that when 3665 was disturbed by a later grave it still had some soft tissue preserved.

This individual's grave was dug just deep enough  to touch a plastered surface. The same happened in the case of skeleton 20445's grave. It seems that the people digging the graves generally have stopped on one hard surface that covers the NW corner of Space 40 (not yet numbered, compact and white/light gray with salt accretions) and also have tried not to dig into the walls surrounding Space 40. Perhaps the walls were still visible, perhaps they only looked for soft spots to dig in.

Primary deposition. Overlayered/cut by three later graves, but 0,10 - 0,15 m deeper down than the other graves in the Space 40 and therefore well preserved. It is alsot he only grave where the skeleton has a strong brown and black colour on the limbs and skull. We do not know yet if this is a chemical reaction or somethig else, but the skeleton was buried in articulation and found still mainly undisturbed and in articulation in an anatomical position.
This indicates that the colouring is chemical, caused by something in the surrounding soil, local or before the other individuals were buried, or some kind of wrapping. A wrapping probably would  have affected the rest of the skeleton, for example the ribs, and not only the skull and limbs. The limbs could not have been flexed as tightly as they are unless they were defleshed partially first or compressed by the burial of F3667. Only Space 40 individual flexed so tightly, interesting in combination with the dark colour. Still complete + perfectly articulared, though, which points to binding plus compression.

A considerable amount of human bones was found in the fill, but they were not articulated. The burial was very disturbed by animal activity and the bones were very badly preserved and burnt. At least two individuals were buried in the place - a baby and a juvenile. A skeleton number was given to a skull of a juvenile that was found in the northern part of the cut. Another skull was lying on the southern edge, but due to the very poor condictions of preservation - there were crumbling pieces of the cranium and part of a mandible with some teeth -, it was not given a unit number. On the northern part of the cut, where the first skull was uncovered, more human bones started coming out form different levels of the section, so the excavation was extended to the north.

Even though the extent of the fill could be recognized it is the extent of the cut that shows the true extent of this feature. This doesn't mean that the fill should be seen as arbitrary, but its edges as uncertain.

When excavated the upper arm (side?) was first found, with a humerus where the distal end pointed up. Also the individual's scull was found under its back, and with arms on either side of the skeleton. It seems it was deposited head first. The fill was similar of that of the building infill - compound with inclusions of plaster and clay, and also phytoliths.

The whole act of deposition should be associated with the last (perhaps) usage of the bin F.3698 since it was cut into it. It was also cut in respect to the partition wall F3688. This seems not have been a regular burial. The dead child was not placed in the same manner (with the same care) as F3691 and F7134 in Sp 17. This fill was homogenous and hard to distinguish. The question is if this should be considered a formal burial at all, but rather a deposition of a dead child quickly filled with infill material. The similarity then to a dump may not however mean that the deposition did not have ritual or social connotations."^^xsd:string ;

Primary deposition, disturbed by vicinity to surface and later burial.
There seems to be a pattern in the Space 40 grave cluster. All of the individuals are sub-adults, except for 19472 and 20419, and all of them were buried in separate graves on separate occasions. They all lie down on their left side, except for 20442, 20419 and 20445 being on their right side, with their legs tightly flexed, knees towards the chest and arms flexed with hand close to the chin. The orientation varies. The legs might well have been bound, but there is no evidence of wrapping or such. Two Individuals were buried with necklaces and two with pointed bone tools.
All the graves except for the one of skeleton 20434 were dug just deep enough to touch either a plastered surface (F3669, F3670) or one compact layer in the NW corner of Space 40 (white, light gray with salt accretions, not yet numbered). The grave digger also tried not to dig into the walls surrounding Space 40. Perhaps the walls were still visible, perhaps people just looked for soft spots to dig in. They did not avoid digging into earlier graves, but simply pushed any found older bones towards the edges of the new cut."^^xsd:string ;

The skeleton's head and chest were covered with a film of puddled deposit, the chest part actually containing the imprint of the coffin. These puddled deposits were clean clay deposits that only had charcoal inclusions within them.

The charcoal maybe is associated with some form of burnt deposit placed within the coffin.

The individual was laid with a blue glass jar by their head and had a pair of earrings and a ring.

This burial seems to have been interred the following way: cut 3689 was followed by the burial of the individual within a coffin. After the coffin was covered with rubble mixed orangish brown dirt. Then, a layer of clay was placed above and it seems like the grave was kept open for a while. This is evidenced by the puddling marks just above unit 19865.

At the base of the burial, we began to recover some adult bone, which not only implies the presence of an additional burial beneath f. 3534, but also that the cut [19634] may have truncated the top of athe cut associated with the burial below (which would also make sense with the changing quality of the fill.)"^^xsd:string ;

This feature consists of cut [19668], which is semicircular and truncated in the W and S by cut [19634] to previously excavated burial of a juvenile 19635, fill (19667) which is a compact greyish silty clay mix, and skeleton 19670, a lower leg of a juvenile with a partial foot (tarsals, phalanges, and possible metatarsals present).  This feature is also located to the east of another burial cut [18665], later than [19668].

Feature is located underneath makeup layer (19662), and cut into earlier plaster floor levels.  Therefore, this burial is later than burial 19635, which then truncated 19670 in order to make room for a new burial of a skeleton/juvenile.  It is interesting why they chose to truncate away an earlier burial in the central floor, seeing as though they could have placed 19635 elsewhere in the central floor.  However, it is possible 19670 was truncated because they wanted to maintain proximity to the eastern platforms for later burial, due to ritual/material importance.  It is also possible that the location of 19670 was not maintained in the memory of the house and the truncation was accidental, however, this seems unlikely considering other evidence highlighting the importance of memory at the site (painting/other burials)"^^xsd:string ;

It appears that the burial was made when the inhabitants of the house was doing a remodelling of the space. The basin F.3699 was made smaller, and a new floor was planned. When they had made the feature smaller they cut the new addition for the burial before laying a floor patch over the reduced part. This is very clear stratigraphically.

The cut for the burial was relatively deep, but small in size, and the baby to be buried was actually placed leaning on the western slope, perhaps in a sitting resting position (see sketch). Unfortunately, some bones are missing due to animal furrowing. But the preservation of the remaining were quite good, and it seems to be a neonate-perinate individual. Could be stillborn? One grave object was X-finded, a small piece (the tip?) of an obsidian flake. Also in the top of the fill, an animal phalanx was observed. 

This burial should be regarded as similar to the foundation burial concept, in that it was buried prior to the finishing of a big remodelling of the spatial organisation of activity in this space (Sp17). That means also, prior to a new phase of usage of esp. F3699."^^xsd:string ;

Feature 1467 is burial- presumably 'late' as it cuts Neolithic deposits. Possibly Byzantine.
Feature comprises, Grave cut, mud-brick lining, skeleton and fill.
Orientation of feature E-W. Presumably related to burial.

Discussion:
Feature 1467 is a burial, possibly of Byzantine Date (although no finds were recovered that could provide definite dating). Initially fill 12397 was recognised as a deposit of darker looser material than its surroundings. Later it was recognised that the grave had a lining of fairly unevenly sized mud-bricks. The fill was excavated and skeleton 12398 was exposed. Due to the shallow depth of the feature- and therefore the significant amount of truncation/ weathering- the skeleton was in very poor condition. The skull was almost completely truncated, but as the skeleton appeared to be lying slightly on its right side, the right hand, leg and foot survived relatively better. The skeleton was lifted (due to its condition it was lifted in a fairly poor condition) and the mud-brick lining was exposed, recorded and removed. A 'slot' was at this point observed running around the edge of the cut. This had been cut to house the mud-brick lining. The skeleton itself rested on a raised area between the slot. The base was unlined. There were no associated grave goods."^^xsd:string ;

Grave has upstanding walls several courses (approx 0.50m) higher along the north edge, while brick lining and fill had been chopped away by subsequent actions on all remaining sides. Grave upper layers contained a few human bones, and lots of mudbrick-like material. As this was removed, a coffin cut became apparent, indicated by soft soil around the outer edge and by lines of coffin nails. The skeleton was almost completely articulated, and appears to be a young adult female. No grave goods were found. All layers in this grave were easy to see and dig, and any uncertainties quickly became clear during excavation. The grave was one of the best-preserved yet discovered in trench 5.

15326: when we finished the grave skeleton no 15307, unit 14274, we started to lift mudbricks. While we were lifting the mudbricks we found some bones, ceramics, very little obsidian. The colour of the soil is tan, light brown. After we took the mudbricks out the floor we saw the mudbricks which is the made of floor. So we gave up lifting the mudbricks."^^xsd:string ;

Burial- presumably late but dating to before constructioni of Building 41- Byzantine building - as truncated by construction cut of foundation = 12627.
Infant burial - skeleton laid in lining of reused Roman / Byzantine floor and roof tiles and burial covered with the same.
Discussion:
Late burial. Roman / Byzantine dating from tiles of the lining and cover. Dates to before construction of Building 41 (Byzantine structure) as Feature 1476 is truncated by construction cut 12627.
Burial had a lining of reused Roman / Byzantine roof and floor tiles and a cover of the same. The lining and cover 'contained' the skeleton and two fills. A further backfill - 12655 covered the entire burial.

The skeleton - of a 1.5 - 2 year old infant was in good condition (as to the survival of the bones) but was truncated by the construction of the foundations of B41 - resulting in the loss of the skull. The full extent of the feature - including the tile lining is unclear- due to this truncation.
The skeleton was excavated, planned and lifted by LDH"^^xsd:string ;
