Part excavated in FT 3 in 2007

This space sheet is used to summarize the 2012 season excavation of the grave cluster of space 40. It is not a complete documentation for space 40, but a convenient way to sum up what we have done this far. Please not that the below is preliminary observations before the human remains team's analyses.

The grave cluster in the north-west corner of space 40 was excavated during four weeks by two persons with additional help from the human remains team and one extra student. It consisted of eleven graves, all primary burials on separate occasions and in separate cuts. Nine of the individuals were subadults, one was an adult and one was an adult or a young adult. Two were buried with pointed bone tools and two had been wearing stone beads necklaces. A few of the early graves were severely disturbed by the later graves, but most skeletons were well preserved and more or less in articulation.

All individuals were laid down on their left side except for skeletons 20419, 20442 and 20445 which were lying on their right side. They all had tightly flexed legs with the knees towards the chest and more or less flexed arms with hands towards the chest or towards the chin. The orientation varied. The legs might have been bound, but there was no evidence of wrapping or such.

With exception for skeleton 20434, which was buried 0,10-0,15 m deeper than the other individuals, the graves were dug just deep enough to touch a plastered surface (F3669, 3670) or a compact layer or part of layer in the north-west corner of space 40 (light gray with salt accretions, not yet numbered). The grave diggers also avoided digging into the walls surrounding space 40. Perhaps the walls were still visible, perhaps people just looked for soft spots to dig in. They did not avoid digging into older graves, though, but simply pushed any older bones found towards the edges of the new cut. In some cases these older elements were still partly articulated.

For a while we thought that the graves were paert of a platform, but probably they are not. Facts pointing in this way are F3670's slight intrusion into the west wall and, especially, the eastern part of the grave cluster floating out a bit too freely and far to the east. It was hard to tell, though, as the surface was just by the modern ground level and badly eroded. Preliminary, before the rest of space 40 is excavated, we think that the graves were dug into the space after the house were backfilled. The grave infill and the surrounding material, though, is very homogenous and not really looking like house infill.

All infills being very similar to each other and the surrounding material caused problems defining the grave cuts. Probably the infills have been dug up and reused again and again within a limited time span. The positions of the skeletons and disarticulated elements, though, provided a good picture of the cuts and the stratigraphy.

If that's the case the gap/passage might have had a shelf partly over it. S93 seems to have been a storage room (see feture and unit sheets for the content of the bins) as well as a room for processing the food and making tools. God indication for the latest is the presence of stones with marks on them as well as the long bones (suitable for bone tools) within F.2040.
The bucranium 11944 fallen on the floor could have ben attached to a wall.
Phasing: we , at this stage, could see at least two phases of existence within S93. Arguments for that are:
-blocked (upot a point) passage F. 2186
-fact that the bins are built against wall plaster, clearely added at a later stage"""^^xsd:string .

Incorporated in 4040. Space 94 is the central room of B52 comunicating with S93 through a possible apin the wall 2032, but solid evidences for that we do not have due to the collapse of wall 2032.
It also communicates with space 254 through crawl hole 2181.
The extent of S94 towards east is unknown for the moment since B51 was built on top of it covering the flor 2176. We can only estimate that it is probably as large as B51 since the burnt wall south of this seams to have been the limit of our space and it extends all the way behind B51. We can't distinguish internal phases within S94.
Southern end of S94 is narrower than the rest due to the presence of the wall 2180 and post 2178. The area is occupied by raised (high) patform 2177, with bench 2021 on its northern side. The location of the bench on the side of the platform makes it asymetrical, having the northern side a lot higher than the southern one.
Bench is lined with multiple layers of plaster that cover the walls as well.. It had three horn cores fixed on the northern side, which were preserved in the bench clay, despite the breaking and collapse of it.
In the western wall 2106, bucranium 2175 was set into a niche-like space , being fixed with the wall plaster that comes right against it. Under the bucranium probably on the plaster of the north-western platform 2174, against the wall, a pair of goat horns was found.
 On the same wall north from the bucranium, there is a pillar 2172, surrounded by the layers of plaster that cover the wall.
Wall 2032 is a partition wall between S93 and S94, lined with multiple layers of plaster that go arround the post 2173 at the eastern end.
Together posts 2173 and 2178 seem to make a division wihin S94, divisionby those who built B51, precisely.
The disuse o B52, judgeing from the evidences within S94 , seems to have been an accidentalfire with all the construction collapsing inside, but with subsequent activity as te building b51 and the deliberate placement of horns cluster 10281 on top of the building collapse debris."""^^xsd:string .

Building 51 comprised a single small room Space 98. Two stepped platforms lay against the north wall with a niche cut into the east wall leading on to the NE platform and a post pit at the southern end of it. Phytolith traces of a woven mat were also clearly preserved on the surface of the NE platform. The southern area of the building functioned as the food production area with a hearth surrounded by a raised boundary. There was no oven but the hearth was set relatively close to the southern wall in the position where ovens are frequently positioned and is the likely location of the entrance ladder. Positioned in the southeastern corner were a bench, a pedestal, and a double basin. 
The most important piece of information about this structure is that it appears to have been built as a replacement for Building 52, which was destroyed by fire. Building 51 was constructed within the walls of a cleared out area of the burnt building in the northeast corner.

(Only the final phase of the building was exposed. The entire building is contained within one space. Because the excavation finished at the final phase it is not possible to relate the building stratigraphically to the surroundng buildings at this stage. (added 10/08/05- it now seems that building 51 was built after the fire in building 52 and contained within its area.)
The only post scar visible is on the eastertn wal an this may represent the point of access.
The southern area of the space may have once been partitioned from the rest and this is where cooking took place. The hearth is detached from the wall and would not have been domed. Two platforms form the northern end of the space.
At the end use of the building the final fired debris was not cleared from the hearth. The space was subsequently infilled with relatievly sterile material. The uopper most fill was mixed with some chalcolithic pottery)"""^^xsd:string .

Northern part of the space 112, 2/3 of which has been excavated in 1997 by the present project. In effect the area dealt with here is the northern platform on Mellart's 1964 dig plan, which is bounded to the south by two parts. Floors were badly truncated, wheathered and preserved only in parches, which makes reconstruction more difficult.

At present it is clear that a series of burials preceded the removal of the parts in 1703 and 1705. First came a double burial of a man ( 10840) and a sheep (10839)  set into a very deep cut (10811- F1702) Next burials 1711 and 1710 were put in and finally 1709 disturbed both these burials. In that process the skull of 1711 seems to have been lifted. It was found in the fill of the post retrival pit 1705.

It is not clear ......... (can't read this part) .......  of the two floor sequences ( 10806 and 10801) this should be correlated. 

The internal support walls that were put in half way through the sequence in the part of sp 112 excavated in 1997 were lacking in this area, so space 112 in the north was bounded by wall 267 to the west, 1701 to the north and F.259 to the east.

To the south SP.132 extends beyond the limit of excavation. SP. Is characterised by severe pitting- generally intercutting pits. These pits cut through laminated midden and can be filled with laminated midden deposits. They can cut through more compact building debris dumps and can be filled with midden, and they can cut through compact dumps and befilled with compact dumps. So, there is no uniform activity pattern occuring- some may be quarry pits otheirs may be disposal pits in the case of the laminated midden pits. These deposits are characterised by what lisa Marie has identified as faeces interspersed with ash lenses. Could these deposits have been quarried for their organic content, for use in the fields?? Otherfeatures of this space include a hearth or oven that was only partially exposed within the excavation area (F.2701). This all fits within the south around about the same phase (FS)"""^^xsd:string .

At some point between the floors (often a number of roughly 14) an oven was constructed in the middle of the lower area of the space. This was cut into the earlier floors, ovardal shape and probably had a cover (see feature 1555 sheet and its unit sheets). When the oven was not in use any more they backfilled the pit and seal it under subsequent floors. This later floors are a bit different from the earlier ones, being mostly white plaster.

With this later floors, on the S-E corner of the space, a bin was functioning. This was a rectangular feature (brick and mortar) divided in two square spaces by one brick. In the fill of it we found a cluster of large sheards.

	c:description """Space 261 holds an area of midden. It is located in the south shelter and is thought to belong to levels 5/6. The space is bounded to the west by the external wall F1523 of B53, to the south by the southern edge of the shelter, to the north, by the eroded slope of post Mellaart excavations, and to the east, it is arbitrary defined. The space is 5.5 meters by 3.08 meters, east to west and north to south respectively. 

Excavation of this space began in the 2005 season and continued through the 2006 season. At the end of the 2006 season the excavation of the space remains incomplete. From the excavation to this point, however, 4 broad phases of activity for life of the space and midden, can now be recognised. Starting with the latest phase:

(I) Post Building 53. This phase contains units 11377 and 11370. The units are layers of midden that have built up over the wall of B53, therefore post dating the activity associated with B53. Both units are described as compound layers, with formation occurring from a mixing of general landscape erosion in association with domestic dumping. 

(II) Contemporary with B53. In stratigraphic order from top to bottom, this phase contains units 11379, 11397, 12500, and 12501. All these unit layers have the same formation process as the Post Building 53 phase. They are, however, seen to abut the wall F1523, of the B53, so the layers are likely to be contemporary with B53 activity. It is difficult to say, how many buildings were using the midden for dumping during this time, but it is likely that a good proportion of this material originated from B53 activity. Unit 11379 is of particular interest, containing two animal bone clusters 11392, and 11393. The clusters appear to have been deposited synchronously and may represent activity of special significance (cf., animal archive report 2005). Stratigraphically, they are held within the last unit layer to have formed before the closure/demolition of B53. It is tempting to draw a link between the two episodes.

(III) Construction of B53. This phase contains a pit cut F1531 and a cut 14321 mainly for the wall F1523, but also for F1533 (3 extant bricks only. Now removed). Both features cut through layer 12502, the last layer seen to have formed before B53 was constructed. 

Wall cut 14321. At the end of the 2006 season the wall was not released on its west side. On the east side of the wall a cut has been tentatively identified. Not including the unit layers associated with walls F1523 and F1533 (which technically belong in the cut), the cut contains unit layers 14322, 12552, 12525, and 12521. These layers appear to have functioned in the following way:

(1) 14322, may have acted as the initial foundation layer. This layer goes under the walls. (2) 12552, acting as further foundation material and also backfill. This layer was seen to go under and also against the outer part of the wall F1523. (3) Further backfill with layers (12521) and (12525). Both of these layers were seen to be above the last course of both F1523 and F1533. 

It should be noted though, that removal of wall F1523 and further excavation under the wall is needed to clarify the certainty of the cut area and the subsequence sequence of events that appear to follow. 

Pit F1531. The pit is located in the far northeast corner of Space 261. Its full extent is not known due to the limits of excavation here. The pit was excavated in broad stratagraphic layers. This approach was dictated by the extreme lensing of the midden material in the pit. Despite this though, a likely sequence for the pit could be determined. From earliest to latest this sequence is as follows.

(1) Cut 12518. Construction/excavation of the pit. Why was it cut? Two functions are suggested here for the pit, a primary quarry function and a secondary midden function. 

Quarry function. This is suggested here as the pit’s primary function, because of its location. It cuts through an area of midden containing old bricks, natural sediments, bone, ash, charcoal, and obsidian. This type of compound layered material is often evident in the matrix of the bricks and mortar used for walls, which suggests that the material recovered from the pits excavation could also have been used in this way. If this was the case, this essentially gives the pit a construction function. 

Midden function. This is discounted here as the primary function of the pit, as it seems unlikely that an established in use area of midden, was cut into to dig a pit for the purpose of dumping more midden. It is clear, however, by the layers that formed in the pit, subsequent to its cut, that the pit had a secondary function for dumping midden into.

(2) Layer 12514. This layer was incompletely excavated due to its continuation below 1.2m against the baulk section. Formation of the layer is probably in part, a result of feature side and ground surface erosion. This is suggested by the broken brick material, which is visible in the west facing section. A similar type of material is evident in the north and northwest sides of pit, probably acting as the redeposited source material for some of this layer. In general, this layer has an unsettled appearance to it, suggesting some uncontrolled deposition. 

(3) Layer 12558. This layer contains a very high quantity of thin ashy lenses. Some rubble brick material can also be seen in the layer suggesting some continued instability of the surrounding space. The tight banding of ash and charcoal lenses, however, suggest the material is being anthropogenically deposited. 

(4) Layer 12511. A very homogenous layer, which appears isolated to the north area of the pit. The homogeneity of the layer suggests a slump of some sort or a large dump, probably relating to a single episode of formation activity The layer bears some similarities to floor construction material. If so, it may be excess construction material being dumped. The layer splits 12558 and 12504. 

(5) Layer 12504. This is the continuation of 12558. In this part of the layer the charcoal and ash lenses are very tight and clear. The source of the material may be from hearth and/or oven rake-out cleaning and then dumping. This layer was prioritised with this question in mind. It was hoped especially that the analysis of the obsidian from the heavy residue would point to something, as pressure flaking debitarge can show up in hearth/oven rake-out waste. No conclusive answer was, however evident. It is hoped though that further post excavation analysis of samples taken will add to the interpretation and clarify the source material for this layer’s formation. 

(6) Layer 12529. An earthy layer containing animal bone in high quantity. May have once spread out beyond the cut of the pit. Similar areas were noticed with excavation of 12502, and it seems quite likely that some of 12502 would have eroded into the pit. The layer has a tertiary like look to it, but the animal bone quantity suggests the pit was probably still in use as a visible and utilised feature. 

(7) Layer (12501). Similar to 12529.

In summary, there are two features discussed in this section, a wall cut, and a pit cut. Both can be argued to have a building construction function. The wall cut, to set the foundation for building of B59 and the pit to supply material for brick and mortar construction. As mentioned above, both features cut layer 12502, the last layer seen to have formed before the building of B53. Both features are then straitigraphically in phase with each other. This raises the question as to whether or not they were related activities. At this stage this question is difficult to answer. It may however be possible in the future to get closer to an answer when compositional analysis of both the midden material and the bricks and mortar is completed. If a direct link could be established by similarities in material, then the pit’s function becomes integrally caught up with the construction of B53.  

(IV) Pre Building 53. This phase contains midden layers 12502, 12508, 12519, 12524, 12526, 12532, 12539, 12540, 12549, and 12553. This section of the midden can be divided into 4 groups (A-D).

Group A. Layers 12502, and 12508, have a similar appearance to each other. Both are compound layers, containing lenses of ash and charcoal mixed with natural sediments. Formation of the layers then seems likely to be from a mix of intentional dumping in association with natural silting events. The natural silting may indicate that the midden was used sporadically, and/or that there was some unstable material nearby eroding into the space. If there is a visible difference between the 2 layers, it is that towards the middle to lower part of 12508, ash and charcoal lenses become more numerous. 

Group B. Layers, 12519, 12524, and 12526, can also be defined as a broad group. They are also compound layers, but they all contain a much higher element of ash and charcoal lensing. The concentration of pure midden waste, is therefore much higher than 12502 and 12508. The ash and charcoal seems likely to be derived from hearth and oven clean out associated with domestic activities. 

Layer 12524 deserves some special mention. Along with the compound layer material, this layer contains (not fully excavated) at least two sequences of alternating charcoal and a lime like lenses. The lime lenses reach a maximum thickness of 50cm and the charcoal, a max thickness of 25cm. There is some suggestion that these lenses have formed insitu, as a reddish, scorched like surface is visable beneath the lower lense of charcoal. The significane of these lenses is not yet known, as excavation of this area had to be put on hold and will now continue next season. Various samples, though, of the lenses have been taken for analysis, with the results not yet finalised. There is, however, some suggestion, that the lenses represent insitu lime burning events with the aim to create material for the plastering of the walls, platforms, bins etc., for the buildings. 

Group C. This section of the midden contains layers 12532, 12539, and 12540. Layers 12532 and 12540, are made up from the dumping of a burnt demolished building. Both layers contain high quantities of burnt bricks and burnt plaster. Layer 12539, splits layers 12532 and 12540, as it did not contain the element of burnt bricks and plaster that 12532 and 12540 have. However, it appears that all layers belonged to the same activity associated with dumping of demolished material.

Group D. Two unrelated layers make up this group, 12539 and 12553. They lay under 12540 but are physically separated from each other. Layer 12539, contained compound midden material, as well as some burnt building material, and layer 12553, was a thin layer of charcoal. The charcoal layer is interesting as it separates 12540, from another episode of burnt building material. Laying physically under 12539 also is further burnt building material. Excavation for the 2006 season had to finish at this point, but the question for next season here will be to determine why this burnt demolished building material is stratigraphically separated. It could be that there is more than one event of burnt building clearance, or it could simply be that the midden had undergone extensive post depositional changes, obscuring relationships and in turn making interpretation difficult. 

FINDS RECOVERED FROM MIDDEN IN SPACE 261

Finds recovered from the midden area included: Domestic waste material, such as, pottery fragments, stone, animal bone, and obsidian waste. Personal and utilitarian objects, included; beads (made from stone, bone, clay and shell), clay balls (small and large), clay figurines (zoomorphic and humanoid), a greenstone axe fragment, horn core fragment, worked bone points, and worked obsidian blades and flakes and projectile points. Two pigment stones were also recovered, adding an esoteric element to finds from this space (DB)"""^^xsd:string .

Discussion:
The area of building 64 was subsequently used as an external space.  Following the abandonment of building 64 a series of pits were dug probably to extract building materials for use in the maufacture of mudbricks.  The extent of the space is delimited by the extent of the pitting to the north and east, the turncation of the foundation trench of building 41 to the south and the L.D.E. for 2006 to the east.  One large pit was excavated in 2005 to the east and probably represents the age of this activity area.  

In the first phase a serie sof intercutting its were dug and left open (see photo). 
In phase 2 the pits were used for the disposal of rubbish and a thick series of midden layers built up.
In phase 3 a single large pit was dug and was again used to extract building material. This pit was rapidly backfilled by shovelling midden into the cut
In phase 4 the midden was again used as a midden dump and midden formed over the entire space.

Belongs to Phase 2(Phase 1has not been excavated yet)
The kerb (F1989) indicate that the present features(the platforms)are constructed in the late phase.
Since the platforms can not be located in the middle of a space and since the kerb clearly a late addition,we think that the platform and the floor of 284 belong to the late phase."""^^xsd:string .

Small space in SW corner of building 52. Accessed from N through crawlhole F2181. Possible storage space. Appears to have been 'closed' not abandoned after burning of building 52. No wall plaster survives on N or W walls. Floors are scoured out, small area of truncated floors survives in SE corner. A feature (F 1487) is visible in E side of room, probably a shallow basin, however it is sealed by later floor layers.

A cut F1488 at the E side of the space was originally interpreted as a construction cut for wall F2013. To me it 
looks more like a truncation of wall F2013, possibly by basin F1487 or another feature such as a niche.

The space must have fallen out of use directly after the rest of B52 was destroyed by fire. The space was not burnt (or at least not to the same extent) and appears to have been deliberately 'closed'. This suggests to me that B52 was accidentally burnt and any surviving artefacts/ building material was recovered from the less burnt S. part of the building.

There is a double wall dividing the centre of B52 (F2013 and F2014). Although obscured by F1488 this appears to continue to the S extent of space 290 suggesting spaces 290 and 255 to the E were not constructed at the same time."""^^xsd:string .

The room was probably originally rectangular measuring c4.5m from north to south.  Within the structure an oven was located against the southern wall of the room.  To the north of this were a plaster basin and a sequence of plastered floors, which may have been the base of a series of bins to the north of the space. There were also some residual structures that may have been associated with a platform on the western edge, although these were very badly damaged by the truncation along this side. To the northwest of the space were five small open hearths, (average diameter 0.50m), which all sat in shallow concave depressions, some containing residual fuel. Most of them were in use on their own, being sealed variously by different floor surfaces. Three burials were recovered from the early building sequence."""^^xsd:string .

In the 2008 excavations it was suggested that a series of pits separated the two events, these later used as midden dumps.  It would now appear that both buildings post date the excavation of the pit sequence.  The confusion arose from partial excavation of a series of dump/levelling deposits excavated to the east of the exaction area.  The pits as with Building 75 (and the deposits within Spaces 332 and 333) appear to have been truncated, the upper extents of the areas effectively removed (this truncation episode given the number (16224)).  The continued excavation of the area to the east of Building 75 suggested this may have been an ‘outside’ or open area lying without buildings possibly even a yard area.  This was indicated in 2007 excavation by the presence of numerous fire spots and small fire pits.  Continued excavation of this area this year revealed more fire spots/pits these (16236), (16242), (16243), (16252), and (16257) these lying above  levelling deposit (16238), that in turn sealed a large hearth F. 2640. The hearth was oval in shape with a moulded raised rim, the inner surface (measuring 1.14m by 0.98m) burnt with use.  Two burnt surfaces were associated with the hearth as were eroded plaster surfaces (16535), (16541) and (16550).  The open area was bounded on the west by the east wall of Building 75 and wall F.2625 which ran south from its southern corner. At the south wall meet a series of mudbrick walls (16586), F. 2641, F. 5006 and F.5007 which effectively formed a southern retention for a series of levelling deposits (16451), (17048), (17068), (17077), (17098) and (17302).

The fills, despite containing interesting structural evidence were relatively sterile of material culture, but contained many large bones from both cattle and equid, including several horn cores and carbonised structural elements affording the collection of several good dendrochronological and C14 samples.   
 
The building revealed a number of exciting features preserved by the fire. In Space 336 these included; a ladder scar on the southern wall (SE corner); two engaged plastered decorated pillars on the eastern wall, and what appears to be a burnt off plastered post which would have projected out horizontally over the NE platform.  On the northern wall towards the NE corner is a small plastered rams head, which originally held protruding horns, below this is a small niche. Also, roughly central on the northern wall is a large alcove, and a second niche mirroring the first on the western side of the alcove.  To the west of this was a large plaster covered feature built around three large structural timbers most likely with a wattle frame.  It incorporates a crawl hole to allow access from the north central platform and was most likely for storage although its true purpose is uncertain. The exterior was thickly plastered like the walls of the space and had some form of decorative molding, perhaps a plastered niche.  
 
In space 336 six platforms and a bench were located against the four walls forming a central sunken floor area. The northeast platform F.6051 is particularly noteworthy for its two low pedestals with protruding cattle horn cores creating an enclosure around the platform.  
 
Figure 22: Plan of Building 77 
 
The floors were covered in cultural debris possibly representing and discussed as abandonment deposits with in the abandonment phase, the objects either left in or abandoned during the fire. These included; a large quantity of burnt animal bone, horn and red deer antler, several clusters of grind stone, a number of small polished stone axe heads, several tools and worked bone objects, and a several phytolith impressions either from spiral matting or basketry. In the SE corner around the ladder was a deposit containing burnt seed grain and peas, which were most likely held within a container. From the scatter pattern it seems probable that many of the objects had either hung from the rafters of the roof or fell in from the roof during the early collapse by burning, possibly from a second story."""^^xsd:string .

This space was defined by a mudbrick and plaster revetting wall F.5008 (18515/18516) and thus formed the north western boundary of Space 329.  The wall enclosed an area of roughly 4.60m  north-south by 1.0m east west although its western extent had been truncated by 1960s excavation.  Rather unusually the wall curved at its southern end its line corresponding to an area of previous quarry pitting. The wall appeared to have acted as a retaining wall for a levelling or consolidation deposit (17388) as no features or floors were associated with it.  Its location overlying the former quarry and underlying Building 75 It is possible that both wall and levelling deposit were ground preparation for the construction that structure.

The western limit of the space is set arbitrarily on the section positioned in 2012 along the Grid line: E-1044. Taking into consideration the plan arrangement of the buildings uncovered on the North Shelter the described interior is placed between B.77 (in the North), B.113 (in the East) and Sp.489 (in the South).
-It must be stated at the beginning that the Space 488 has to be treated as a stratigraphical entity as well as recording/documentation one, and not considered as actual inhabited/residential activity space (similar to the Sp.518 underneath). The latter is involved with the fact that the walls described above restricting the space were built for different purposes and diachronically (not simultaneously). Except for F.3626 and F.3627 that were bonded and created N-E corner of the space. Their erection was involved with the aim of setting the building (B.108) on a stable ground that appeared to be the top of two mentioned walls whose height reached 1.58m. The latter shows complicated techniques and tremendous endeavor implicated with desire of building the structure on higher elevation while the neighbouring buildings (e.g. B.77) had been still inhabited on much lower level.
  -The above statement is confirmed by the absolute lack of any features of internal arrangement within the space 488 that would be related with the walls. An additional affirmation might be the southern face of the wall F.3626. It seems that during constructional phases the builders did not care about the vertical line of the wall. It is clear that it was difficult to maintain the straightness in the extremely narrow space 488. Furthermore, re-using the broken bricks was the significant factor of the final disheveled form of F.3626. All those data demonstrate that the appearance was not as important as in typical buildings, because the described part of the feature was plausibly immediately covered by the infill (u. 19580, 20486) that wrapped whole sp.488, creating at the same time suitable base/ground for erection of above structure B.108.
-The reason of erection of the southern wall (F.3646) of Sp. 488 along the northern face of existing counterpart structure (F.3679) remains still unclear. The feature did not have any relations with uncovered units and it was not bonded with any structure at least in its Eastern section. Therefore, interpretation involving construction of the wall with the kind of retaining purpose is still the most plausible. In that case the feature might have been built to keep F.3679 from collapsing on to B.77 (see Archive Report 2012, p:25)."""^^xsd:string .

-The Space 489 was uncovered entirely in 2012 after execution of the midden deposits placed between walls that restricted also interior itself. Its limits were recorded as follows:  from the East - F. 3627, from the South - F. 3623 as well as F.3624 and from the North - F. 3679. The latter feature had been not erected together with its three presented above counterparts since in 2013 the wall was eventually associated with an earlier structure uncovered directly underneath, recorded as Sp.511. 
-There were absolutely no feature related with an internal arrangement of the space 489 nor floor surface, and the faces of the walls had completely no signs of plaster coating. These data on the post-excavation stage (2012) highlighted different types of construction and its unique purpose comparing neighbouring buildings (e.g. from the East-B.113, from the South- B.52, form the North-Sp.488). Similar to the Sp. 488 the actual  walls of Sp.489 (F. 3627, F. 3623, F.3624) were erected on the bottom of the deep foundation cuts (up to 1.58m depth) that were dug out through the midden. 
-All those records demonstrate that the appearance of the walls was not as important as in typical buildings, because the features were plausibly immediately covered by the infill/miden deposits that re-wrapped whole sp.489, creating at the same time suitable base/ground for erection of structure B.108 above them, that was set on the top of the mentioned walls.

He also hit the space hard, cutting all the east and north walls obliquely, effectively bowling out the space. On the west side he encountered features, (bins, platforms, etc.) and eased off; on the east he appears to have hit it harder, scouring out most of the floors and leaing it almost down to the underlying roomfill.

They altogether embrace possible the side-room of a bigger building structure located northward behind the wall F.3679. However, the statement might be verified only by exploration of the western part of the Space that is still covered by the midden and roomfill deposits within the section set arbitrarily in 2012 along the Grid line: E-1044. 
	
The chronological sequence of major uncovered units and features within the Sp.511 comprised of the following subsequently positioned deposits (from the bottom):
The floor [30592] truncated in its southern part by activity or later unclear doings was covered by activity surface [u.30591] consisted of patches and sequences of phytoliths. In the North-Eastern part of the Space there was an unique Bin/container found [F.7139 (infill-30576, plastered structure-30575)]. In the North-Western part of the trench just under the section/profile there was recorded posthole [F.7302 (cut-30552, infill-30151)] used afterwards by animals as a burrow. The whole described sequences were covered by the room-fill [20988] comprised of crushed bricks and mortar as well as number of collapsed fragments of roof (?) and fragments of plaster. The latter deposit was coated by relatively thin midden [20965], that subsequently was covered by two rubbles  (20942, 20943). The latter closed distinctively the last phase of the Sp.511 and the fallen bricks might be easily related with slumping southern wall (F.7125) of the space 511 that must have been effected by a collapsing episode whose nature (natural or intentional) remains unclear."""^^xsd:string .

Two of the above mentioned Features (F.7301 and F.7149) were bonded creating the S-E corner of a bigger structure that might have been probably a “main room” for located southward the side-room assigned as Sp.511. 
	
The eastern wall of the space 518 (F.7149) is made of grey bricks and orange mortar just like its counterparts: F.3679, F.7125, F.7126.
